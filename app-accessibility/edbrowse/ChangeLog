  -edbrowse-3.4.6.ebuild, -files/edbrowse-3.4.6-fix-makefile.patch,
  -files/edbrowse-3.4.6-fix-off-by-one.patch, +edbrowse-3.4.7.ebuild,
  +files/edbrowse-3.4.7-fix-makefile.patch:
  Add latest version to the tree, remove the older unstable version.

  3.4.7 is here.
  3.4.6 was never stabilized.
  It had flaws, like the use of memcpy on overlapping regions.
  No need to keep it in the tree.

  * I am now upstream for this package. HOMEPAGE and SRC_URI were changed
  accordingly.

  Initial commit for edbrowse, a line editor, web browser and email
  client using the ed user interface.
  This was added to app-accessibility due to it mostly being used by blind
  users. 
  Thanks to Chris Brannon <chris@the-brannons.com> for the submission.
  This closes #350183.
