  +files/edbrowse-3.4.6-fix-makefile.patch,
  +files/edbrowse-3.4.6-fix-off-by-one.patch, +metadata.xml:
  Initial commit for edbrowse, a line editor, web browser and email
  client using the ed user interface.
  This was added to app-accessibility due to it mostly being used by blind
  users. 
  Thanks to Chris Brannon <chris@the-brannons.com> for the submission.
  This closes #350183.
