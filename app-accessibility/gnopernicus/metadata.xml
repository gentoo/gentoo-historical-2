     visually impaired person. It enables users with limited vision,
     or no vision, to use the Gnome 2 desktop and Gnome/GTK+-2
     applications effectively. By providing automated focus tracking
     and fullscreen magnification, Gnopernicus will aid low-vision
     Gnome users, and its screen reader features will allow low-vision
     and blind users access to standard GTK+2 and Java-based GUI
     applications via speech and Braille output.
