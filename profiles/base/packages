# Gentoo Base Profile

# NOTE: THIS IS THE BASE PROFILE FOR *ANY* GENTOO BASED (GNU/LINUX) SYSTEM.
# NO MODIFICATIONS MAY BE MADE TO THIS FILE WITHOUT PRIOR DISCUSSION.  IF
# YOU ARE CREATING A NEW PROFILE, YOU SIMPLY NEED TO INHERIT THIS BASE
# PROFILE IN YOUR PROFILE DIRECTORY'S "parent" FILE.


# OK, you're staring at this file and you have no idea what these stars are
# for.  HEre's teh scoop.  An initial "*" marks a package that is part of
# the official BASE system profile.  If there is a "*" then `emerge system`
# will use the line in its calculations of what should be installed for the
# base profile.  Lines without a "*" prefix will be ignored for profile
# system calculations.

# Now, this is new: *all* lines (with or without a star) will be used as a
# special package *inclusion* mask. For example, the line
# *=sys-devel/gcc-2.95.3-r1 will cause Portage to totally ignore all gcc
# ebuilds except for gcc-2.95.3-r1. The notation: >=, >, <=, <, and ~ can be
# used to offer a bit more flexibility.  For example, >=sys-libs/glibc-2.2.4
# will cause Portage to ignore all glibc ebuilds with a version less than
# 2.2.4.  This allows us to have profile-specific package.mask settings.
# *ALL* lines are used for this masking process, whether they are prefixed
# with a * or not.  And if a generic dependency is used, say "sys-apps/foo"
# then all versions of foo are considered.  The key thing to note is that
# this file does not need to end up being an exaustive list of portage
# packages, just the ones critical to this profile hierarchy.

# So, what happens to ${PORTDIR}/profiles/package.mask? It is still around,
# and still useful.  But it should be mainly used for broken ebuilds and
# packages only.  The package.mask continues to function as normal, masking
# out ebuilds from *all* system profiles.

# Which to use? Use the profile-specific stuff to lock down specific
# versions of ebuilds.  Gentoo Linux 1.0_rc6 uses certain known compatible
# versions of binutils, gcc, and glibc so we lock those versions down here.
# This prevents the user from shooting themselves in the foot by installing
# a non-working version.
