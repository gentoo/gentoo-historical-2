This profile (together with Gentoo/FreeBSD 6.1) is considered obsolete
and deprecated. Please don't use this anymore.

To upgrade to Gentoo/FreeBSD 6.2, you need to take the following
steps:

* change the profile to default-bsd/fbsd/6.2/x86;
* if you set your CHOST in /etc/make.conf, change it so that it's
  ix86-gentoo-freebsd6.2 rather than 6.1 (the ix86 part has to be
  replaced with whatever you were using before, i386, i486, i586 or
  i686 depending on your CPU;
* FEATURES=-collision-protect emerge -1 baselayout (it will install
  standard baselayout 1.13) && emerge -C freebsd-baselayout
* etc-update *IMPORTANT*
* emerge -1 binutils gcc 
* emerge -e world

It is not an easy task but it should work. If you need help or you
find problems, join #gentoo-bsd on Freenode.
