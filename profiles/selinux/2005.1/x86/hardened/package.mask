# Mask off gcc-4 for all hardened arches until SSP is sorted out (i.e.
# backport for gcc-4.0 and 4.0/4.1 rigged for SSP support in the C
# library).  After that, may still need to be masked on x86 as some
# PIC assembler that worked pre-4 fails post-4, e.g. bug #104966).
# If you want to play with it, unmask in /etc/portage/package.unmask
# but be prepared to rebuild anything you build with gcc-4, later.

# Mask off glibc-2.4 until the approach for SSP compatibilty is
# resolved in a way that doesn't break running systems, and we
# have a sensible upgrade path.  Advise having a static busybox
# around if you try it in a live system.
