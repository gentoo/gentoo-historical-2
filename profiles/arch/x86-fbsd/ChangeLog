  19 Jan 2009; Alexis Ballier <aballier@gentoo.org> +make.defaults,
  +package.use.mask, +parent, +use.force, +use.mask:
  Add x86-fbsd arch profile; it will be used for freebsd 7.1 and we should
  try to make 6.2 profiles use it if they are going to stay for some time.
  This directory is where lazy people are expected to put the masks for
  missing keywords.
