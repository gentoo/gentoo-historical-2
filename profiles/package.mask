# This is the Gentoo Linux Installer.  This is currently masked because it will
# lead to some serious breakages on a machine.  If you are not developing on
# this package, I would strongly recommend against using it.  If you break your
# system with this, you're on your own.  You have been warned.
# This package now is no longer safe to run except on a system where you are
# planning on doing an install.

# This version is looking for something that is not existing in older patch
# files, causing patching to fail.  I am currently masking this version and
