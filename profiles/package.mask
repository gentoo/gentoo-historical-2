# When you add an entry to the top of this file, add your name, the date, and
# an explanation of why something is getting masked. Please be extremely
# careful not to commit atoms that are not valid, as it can cause large-scale
# breakage, especially if it ends up in the daily snapshot.
#
## Example:
##
## # Dev E. Loper <developer@gentoo.org> (28 Jun 2012)
## # Masking  these versions until we can get the
## # v4l stuff to work properly again
## =media-video/mplayer-0.90_pre5
## =media-video/mplayer-0.90_pre5-r1
#
# - Best last rites (removal) practices -
# Include the following info:
# a) reason for masking
# b) bug # for the removal (and yes you should have one)
# c) date of removal (either the date or "in x days")
#
## Example:
##
## # Dev E. Loper <developer@gentoo.org> (25 Jan 2013)
## # Masked for removal in 30 days.  Doesn't work
## # with new libfoo. Upstream dead, gtk-1, smells
## # funny. (bug #987654)

# Michał Górny <mgorny@gentoo.org> (08 Apr 2014)
# Mask slotted versions of PyPy for removal. Since almost every release
# of PyPy had its own slot, the slotting caused major maintenance issues
# for Python package developers and unfriendly upgrade routine for
# users. It also resulted in PyPy interpreter names incompatible with
# other distributions (e.g. 'pypy-c2.0').
#
# Please switch to non-slotted dev-python/pypy:0 or /pypy-bin:0 instead,
# and the corresponding PYTHON_TARGETS=pypy flag. You may also want to
# consider unmasking >=dev-python/pypy-2.2 first (no binary package
# yet).
#
# The ebuilds will be removed in 30 days. In case of any questions
# or issues, please do not hesitate to write on bug #507090.
