# IMPORTANT: In order to parse this new format, you need Portage 1.6 or later!

# OK; you're staring at this file and you have no idea what these stars are
# for.  Here's the scoop.  An initial "*" marks a package that is part of the
# official "base" system profile.  If there's a "*", then "emerge system" will
# use the line in its calculations of what "should" be installed for this
# profile.  Lines without a "*" prefix will be ignored for profile
# calculations.

# Now, this is new: *all* lines (star or no star) will be used as a special
# package *inclusion* mask.  For example, the line *=sys-devel/gcc-2.95.3-r1
# will cause Portage to totally ignore all gcc ebuilds other than
# gcc-2.95.3-r1.  >=, <=, <, > and ~ can be used to offer a bit more
# flexibility.  For example, >=sys-libs/glibc-2.2.4 will cause emerge to ignore
# all glibc ebuilds with a version less than 2.2.4.  This allows us to have
# profile-specific package.mask settings.  *All* lines are used for this
# masking process, whether they are prefixed with a * or not.  And if a generic
# dep is used, like "sys-apps/foo", then all versions of foo are included.  If
# there is no entry, then all versions of an app are included.  The key thing
# to note is that this file does not need to end up being an exhaustive list
# of portage packages; just the ones critical to this profile.

# So, what happens to /usr/portage/profiles/package.mask?  It's still around,
# and still useful.  But it should mainly be used for broken ebuilds only.
# package.mask continues to function as normal, masking out ebuilds from *all*
# system profiles.

# Which to use?  Use the profile-specific stuff to "lock down" specific
# versions of ebuilds.  Gentoo Linux 1.0_rc6 uses certain known-compatible
# versions of binutils, gcc and glibc, so we lock them down here.  This
# prevents the user from shooting himself/herself in the foot by installing a
# wacky version.
