# Some USE-flags that only die-hards don't want:
# readline:  to have some sane command line editing, e.g. in python
# zlib:      for many things you just want gzip support
# ncurses:   a nice working console drawing library
# ssl:       encrypted connections are a nice feature
USE="readline zlib ncurses ssl"

FEATURES="collision-protect"

# this probably already is like this, but we assure that in prefix we
# have a GNU userland
USERLAND="GNU"
