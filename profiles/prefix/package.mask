# When you add an entry to this file, add your name, the date, and an
# explanation of why something is getting masked.  This file is for
# Prefix profiles only!
#
# NOTE: Please add your entry at the top!
#

## Example:
##
## # Dev E. Loper <developer@gentoo.org> (28 Jun 2012)
## # Masking  these versions until we can get the
## # v4l stuff to work properly again
## =media-video/mplayer-0.90_pre5
## =media-video/mplayer-0.90_pre5-r1
#
# - Best last rites (removal) practices -
# Include the following info:
# a) reason for masking
# b) bug # for the removal (and yes you should have one)
# c) date of removal (either the date or "in x days")
# d) the word "removal"
#
## Example:
##
## Dev E. Loper <developer@gentoo.org> (25 Jan 2012)
## Masked for removal in 30 days.  Doesn't work
## with new libfoo. Upstream dead, gtk-1, smells
## funny. (bug #987654)

# also) we need to probably create virtuals for these, so we can make an
# e2fsprogs-uuid ebuild or something to provide these libs with on Prefix.
