#sys-devel/gcc -hardened
#
# vapier added this, but it's too much.  It prevents doing things like:
#
#   USE=-hardened emerge --oneshot sys-devel/gcc
#
# which we need to be able to do in order to migrate from default-linux
# to hardened.  USE=hardened is default on all the hardened arch profiles.
# Note; we don't inherit from default-linux so we don't need to undo stuff
# that is done there.
