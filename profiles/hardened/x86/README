This is a hardened profile for 2.6-series kernels on x86.  Note that it inherits from
hardened, not hardened/x86.  hardened/x86 is for 2.4-series kernel only and masks stuff
that is only appropriate for 2.6 kernels.  To avoid unnecessary disruption to the 2.4
profile, and to avoid this 2.6 profile having to undo masks in the 2.4 profile, this
profile simply inherits from the base hardened profile (parent = ../..).
