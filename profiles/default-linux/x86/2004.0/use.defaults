# Use this file to override specific mappings indicating which package
# satisfies a particular USE flag.  The base profile (in
# ${PORTDIR}/profiles/base/use.defaults) will already describe those
# mappings which apply to absolutely all architectures.  This file is used
# to describe mappings which are unique to THIS SPECIFIC PROFILE ONLY.
# Note, that these mappings extend the parent profiles' (its own parent,
# grandparent, and so on up to the base profile).  However, mappings that
# are present in the parents can be overridden in this file.
