# Gentoo has switched to 2.6 as the defaults for headers/kernels.  If you wish
# to use 2.4 headers/kernels, then you should do the following to upgrade:
# emerge -n '>=sys-apps/portage-2.0.51'
# cd /etc/
# rm make.profile
# ln -s ../usr/portage/profiles/default-linux/x86/2005.1/2.4 make.profile

# If you wish to use the default 2.6 kernel, do the following:
# emerge -n '>=sys-apps/portage-2.0.51'
# cd /etc/
# rm make.profile
# ln -s ../usr/portage/profiles/default-linux/x86/2005.1 make.profile
