defult-linux/x86/2006.0
This is the Gentoo/x86 development profile not intended for end-users.

If you still want to use this: We don't care if it breaks your system,
expect this to change whenever we feel like it with absolutely no warning,
including changing to be unusable. If you would like to switch to a supported
profile, do the following:

# emerge -n '>=sys-apps/portage-2.0.51'
# cd /etc
# rm make.profile
# ln -s ../usr/portage/profiles/default-linux/x86/2006.0 make.profile
