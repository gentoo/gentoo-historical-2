# This file masks out USE flags that are simply NOT allowed in the default
# profile for any architecture.  This works, for example, if a non-default
# profile (such as the selinux profiles) have a USE flag associated with
# them.

# amd64 only:
emul-linux-x86

# Only used by mips and old amd64 profiles
multilib

# ppc and x86/amd64
x264
