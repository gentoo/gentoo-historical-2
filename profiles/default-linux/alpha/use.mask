# This file masks out USE flags that are simply NOT allowed in the default
# profile for any architecture.  This works, for example, if a non-default
# profile (such as the selinux profiles) have a USE flag associated with
# them.

# These will probably never be supported, for obvious reasons (wrong arch)
