# mips64 n32 packages

# We want 2.6.6+ headers for n32.  2.6.6 headers are not ready for
# general consumption, though, so we lock all other mips profiles
# to 2.4, and unlock 2.6 only for n32.

# binutils-2.15* is broken for n32.  No idea why, but it won't
# build glibc correctly, so lets mask it for now.
*<sys-devel/binutils-2.15.90.0.1.1

# There is apparently something very funny in gcc-3.4.2 on n32.
# Something related to GOT (global offset table).  Have to figure 
# this out eventually.

# n32 needs a relatively modern glibc - Portage Atoms Broke?
