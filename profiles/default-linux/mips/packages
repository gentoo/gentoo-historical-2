# Top-level mips profile

# Not ready for general consumption (except n32)
*<sys-kernel/mips-headers-2.6.6

# IP22 theoretically works fine with 2.6, but more testing needs to be done before
# verifying this officially, so we'll mask 2.6 on Indy only and unmask it for all of
# mips64 and cobalt
*<sys-kernel/mips-sources-2.6.8.1

# Doesn't build/work on o32 mips - Portage Atoms Broke?
# Masked by -* instead
