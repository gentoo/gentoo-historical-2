# Cobalt really only knows about 32bit mips installs, thus o32 is the preferred (And
# highly suggested default).  However, there is limited testing under a 64bit cobalt
# kernel, and as such, limited n32 testing available as well.
#
# n64 is not supported, however.  n32 gets unmasked in its respective profile.
