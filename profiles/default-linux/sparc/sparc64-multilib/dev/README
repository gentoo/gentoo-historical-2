This profile is purely for development purposes only and is subject to break or
even disappear.  If if destroys your system, sorry, but you were warned...
Please let us know, so we can fix the problem, but you ae entering this at
your own risk.

This profile exists to help in development of a pure 64bit userland and a
multilib option.  This profile should be "relatively" safe to use if you want
a pure 64bit environment, but as multilib support in portage is evolving, so
will this profile.  This means that as updates are made to portage, this
profile is subject to change WITHOUT REGARD FOR BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY.  Any
such drastic change will first be discussed on the gentoo-sparc mailing list.

If you are not 100% certain you know what you're getting into by using this
profile, then don't.  It may render your machine utterly useless and will break
things, so if you DO use it, you should only use it in a chroot jail.

If you use this profile or you have any questions, please contact me on IRC.
