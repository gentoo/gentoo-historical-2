Do NOT use this profile.  Doing so will break your machine, you will cry,
and nobody will be there to comfort you because you were warned.  This profile
exists to help in the development of a 64bit userland.  If you are not 100%
certain you know what you're getting into by using this profile, then don't.
It will most certainly render your machine utterly useless and will break
things, so if you DO use it, you should only use it in a chroot jail.

If you use this profile or you have any questions, please contact me on IRC.

As this is a development-only, expirimental profile, it may be removed at
any time without a deprecation warning, so if you do use it, please email me
so I can keep you in the loop.
