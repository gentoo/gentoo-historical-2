# This has been removed until bug #166790 is resolved properly.  If you have a
# problem with this, bring it up to the Council with a working patch.  In case
# you're wondering, GLEP48 also mentions that if the QA team is not in agreement
# that a majority of the QA team must be in agreement.  Both Mike Frysinger and
# myself are on the QA team.  We disagree with the now retired Alexander's
# assessment of the solution to this problem, and as such he cannot use the
# provisions in GLEP 48 as an argument for his actions without a vote from the
# QA team or Council override.
