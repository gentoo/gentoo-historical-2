# Since we don't ever build stages against this profile, STAGE1_USE isn't seti
# in here, but instead is set in the sub-profiles. We do set USE, though, for
# the minimal USE that is shared between both 32-bit and 64-bit userlands.
# Stages 2 and 3 are built against the USE here, so be careful what you add.
