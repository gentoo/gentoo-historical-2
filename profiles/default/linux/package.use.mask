# Udev does not support reading compressed hardware databases.
# Upstream was approached about adding this functionality to udev;
# however, the idea was rejected (see comment #28 of the bug below).
# Since pciutils only stores the compressed database on disk when the
# zlib use flag is on and usbutils is moving toward doing the same,
# the udev maintainers (myself and Robin Johnson <robbat2@gentoo.org>)
# agree that the best way forward for this bug is to package.use.mask
# zlib for pciutils and usbutils until the upstreams agree or udev
# upstream moves away from using the databases these packages provide.
# This way, zlib support can be left on for everything else and neither
# udev nor base-system needs to carry custom patches.
# Please do not unmask without speaking to myself and Robin.
# See bug #360849 for the details.

# Mask oss USE flag for PulseAudio; it's present for compatibility
# with FreeBSD and other operating systems that have no better
# interfaces, but people would probably abuse it with Linux as well.
#
# Older versions also had an OSS compatibility wrapper on that USE so
# they are excluded.

# Mask usb USE flag for newest PCSC-Lite, since on Linux we want to
# use libudev instead.
