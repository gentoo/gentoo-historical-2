# 
# FEATURES are settings that affect the functionality of portage. Most of
#     these settings are for developer use, but some are available to non-
#     developers as well. 
#
#  'sandbox'     enable sandbox-ing when running emerge and ebuild
#  'sfperms'     feature for security minded people that causes portage to 
#                remove group+other readable bits on setuid files and
#                remove the other readable bits on setgid files.
#  'strict'      causes portage to react strongly to conditions that
#                have the potential to be dangerous -- like missing or
#                incorrect Manifest files.
#  'userpriv'    allows portage to drop root privleges while it is compiling
#                as a security measure, and as a side effect this can remove 
#                sandbox access violations for users.
#  'usersandbox' enables sandboxing while portage is running under userpriv.
#                unpack -- for debugging purposes only.
