The Ladebug Debugger is a powerful, fully symbolic debugger that helps you locate runtime errors (bugs) in your code. Ladebug allows you to:
Perform source-level debugging,
Attach to a running process,
Debug programs with shared libraries,
Debug massively parallel program.
Ladebug is a command-line debugger much like gdb. It provides extensive support for debugging programs written in C, C++, and Fortran (77 and 90) and compiled with the Compaq Linux Alpha compilers, which generate Dwarf-2 debugging information. Ladebug comes with an extensive html manual. This is the same debugger that HP ships on its Tru64 systems.
