	Git - Fast Version Control System. Official titled
	"GIT - the stupid content tracker". 

	Git is a popular version control system designed to handle very large
	projects with speed and efficiency; it is used mainly for various open
	source projects, most notably the Linux kernel.

	Git falls in the category of distributed source code management tools,
	similar to e.g. GNU Arch or Monotone (or BitKeeper in the proprietary
	world). Every Git working directory is a full-fledged repository with full
	revision tracking capabilities, not dependent on network access or a central
	server.
