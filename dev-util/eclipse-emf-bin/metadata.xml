EMF is a modeling framework and code generation facility for building tools and
other applications based on a structured data model. From a model specification
described in XMI, EMF provides tools and runtime support to produce a set of
Java classes for the model, a set of adapter classes that enable viewing and
command-based editing of the model, and a basic editor. Models can be specified
using annotated Java, XML documents, or modeling tools like Rational Rose, then
imported into EMF. Most important of all, EMF provides the foundation for
interoperability with other EMF-based tools and applications.
