Meta-CVS is a version control system built around CVS. Although it
retains most of the features of CVS, including all of the networking
support, it is more capable than CVS, and easier to use. Its main
features are:

 * Directory structure versioning
 * User-friendly file type handling
 * Sane corner cases
 * Simple branching and merging
 * Support for symbolic links and meta-data
 * Tracking of third party code containing moves and renames
 * Ease of deployment
