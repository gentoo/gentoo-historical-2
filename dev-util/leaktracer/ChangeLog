  29 Apr 2004; David Holm <dholm@gentoo.org> leaktracer-2.4.ebuild:
  Added to ~ppc.

*leaktracer-2.4 (06 Jan 2004)

  06 Jan 2004; Sergey Kuleshov <svyatogor@gentoo.org> leaktracer-2.3.ebuild,
  leaktracer-2.4.ebuild:
  Bumping the version number to 2.4. I repackaged the tarball to name it
  leaktracer-VERSION.tbz2 and uploaded to gentoo mirrror. The maintainer
  doesn't seem to keep older versions on his web site. Cause of this had to
  remove 2.3.

*leaktracer-2.3 (08 Sep 2003)

  08 Sep 2003; Sergey Kuleshov <svyatogor@gentoo.org> leaktracer-2.3.ebuild,
  files/LeakCheck-gentoo.patch:
  Renamed from LeakTracer to leaktracer to conform with the policy.

*LeakTracer-2.3 (06 Sep 2003)

  06 Sep 2003; Sergey Kuleshov <svyatogor@gentoo.org> LeakTracer-2.3.ebuild,
  files/LeakCheck-gentoo.patch:
  Initial commit, thus closing bug #13761. Thanks to Michael Labhard
  <m.labhard@comcast.net> for the ebuild.
