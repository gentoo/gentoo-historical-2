strace assumes that if PT_GETSIGINFO is defined, you're building for ia64 as
this was the only architecture that exported PT_GETSIGINFO via glibc userspace
headers.  with newer glibc's, support for PT_GETSIGINFO has been added to all
linux architectures so we can no longer assume PT_GETSIGINFO == ia64.
