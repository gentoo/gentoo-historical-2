# NOTE: For some reason, upstream has changed the naming scheme
# for the tarballs to something quite lame:
# strace_version-revision.tar.gz
# This makes it difficult for us to deal with, because portage
# is supposed to glean the package version information from the
# filename of the ebuild. Grr
# Thus, *MAINTAINER*: change the *revision* in the SRC_URI below
# by hand. Sorry, couldn't think of a better way.
