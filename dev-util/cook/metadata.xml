    Cook is a tool for constructing files. It is given a set of files to
    create, and recipes of how to create them. In any non-trivial program
    there will be prerequisites to performing the actions necessary to
    creating any file, such as include files. Cook provides a mechanism to
    define these.

    When a program is being developed or maintained, the programmer will
    typically change one file of several which comprise the program. Cook
    examines the last-modified times of the files to see when the
    prerequisites of a file have changed, implying that the file needs to be
    recreated as it is logically out of date.

    Cook also provides a facility for implicit recipes, allowing users to
    specify how to form a file with a given suffix from a file with a
    different suffix. For example, to create filename.o from filename.c
