  Cook is a tool for constructing files. It is given a set of files to create,
  and recipes of how to create them. In any non-trivial program there will be
  prerequisites to performing the actions necessary to creating any file, such
  as include files. Cook provides a mechanism to define these.

  Ebuild submitted by Sean Mitchell <sean@arawak.tzo.org>.
