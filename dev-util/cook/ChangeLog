*cook-2.18 ( 18 Feb 2002 )

  18 Feb 2002; Karl Trygve Kalleberg <karltk@gentoo.org> ChangeLog cook-2.18.ebuild files/digest-cook-2.18

  Cook is a tool for constructing files. It is given a set of files to create,
  and recipes of how to create them. In any non-trivial program there will be
  prerequisites to performing the actions necessary to creating any file, such
  as include files. Cook provides a mechanism to define these.

  Ebuild submitted by Sean Mitchell <sean@arawak.tzo.org>.
