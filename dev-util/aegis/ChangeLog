*aegis-4.2 (13 Apr 2002)

  13 Apr 2002; Karl Trygve Kalleberg <karltk@gentoo.org> aegis-4.2.ebuild files/digest-aegis-4.2 :
  
  Aegis is a transaction-based software configuration management system. It 
  provides a framework within which a team of developers may work on many 
  changes to a program independently, and Aegis coordinates integrating these 
  changes back into the master source of the program, with as little 
  disruption as possible.
