*netbeans-3.3.2.ebuild ( 28 Jun 2002 )

  28 Jun 2002; George Shapovalov <george@gentoo.org> netbeans-3.3.2.ebuild, files/digest-3.3.2 :

  new version released, updated ebuild to comply with present requirements;
  (updated versions were submitted by Tejaswi Kasturi <tej@kasturi.org>
  and Heiko Helmle <helman@gmx.net>).
  Added few licenses under which parts of the package are released, still 
  need to add few more.
  I could not fetch sources from a few locations, however Tejaswi claims 
  he never had difficulty fetching them. Therefore I am committing and masking 
  new version. Will unmask when licenses are all added and SRC_URI checked.
