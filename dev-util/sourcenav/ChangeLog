  +files/sourcenav-5.1.4-bash3.patch, +files/sourcenav-5.1.4-gcc4.patch,
  sourcenav-5.1.4.ebuild, sourcenav-5.2_beta2.ebuild,
  -sourcenav-5.1.1.ebuild:
  removed broken older version and updated stable with gcc4 and bash3 patches
  (old bug reopened).  Still thinking about stablizing a beta release (since
  it may be the last official upstream release for the forseeable future).

  +files/sourcenav-5.2_beta2-gcc4.patch, sourcenav-5.2_beta2.ebuild:
  Added fix for bug 131412 (gcc 4 barfs on -fwritable-strings).  Thanks to

  12 Jul 2003; <rac@gentoo.org> sourcenav-5.1.4.ebuild,
  files/sourcenav-5.1.4-gentoo.diff:
  On behalf of nerdboy@gentoo.org, who writes: updated ebuild for 5.1.4 and
  fixed more sandbox violations. I changed the ebuild to more closely follow the
  standard build procedures (but I guess I don't get a cookie, since my patch
  file is bigger than the previous one).

*sourcenav-5.1.1 (01 Nov 2002)

  Updated the patch to fix the sandbox violation,
  which caused itcl not to be installed.

  01 Nov 2002; Daniel Ahlberg <aliz@gentoo.org> :
  New name and version bump. Found by Nicholas Wourms <nwourms@netscape.net> in #5863.

*snavigator-5.0 (1 Feb 2002)

  30 Oct 2002; S.Jones <cretin@gentoo.org>:

  Changed emake to make and added mkdir -p ${D}/etc/env.d/ to fix ebuild.
  
  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
  
  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
