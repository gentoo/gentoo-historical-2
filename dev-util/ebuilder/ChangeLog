*ebuilder-0.4-r1 (06 May 2002)

  06 May 2002; Zach Forrest <zach@disinformation.ca> ebuilder, experted.ebuild, beginner.ebuild :

  Thanks to Karl T for the great feedback and suggestions. (I'll get to
  the rest of them in the next version.)

  Fixed -h|--help options (i.e. they now display the help).

  Added a man page.

  Added support for the LICENSE variable in ebuilds; a menu is displayed.

  Can now add pkg_setup and pkg_config skeleton methods.

  Fixed the Python src_install method so that the --prefix is now /usr.
  This was mentioned on the developers mailing list by Jon Nelson
  <jnelson@jamponi.net>.

  A revision number can now be added to the package name.

  Changed the fourth line in the ebuilds to "$Header: /var/cvsroot/gentoo-x86/dev-util/ebuilder/ChangeLog,v 1.3 2002/05/16 21:42:16 karltk Exp $".
