CVSup is a software package for distributing and 
updating collections of files across a network. It can 
efficiently and accurately mirror all types of files, 
including sources, binaries, hard links, symbolic 
links, and even device nodes. CVSup's streaming 
communication protocol and multithreaded architecture 
make it most likely the fastest mirroring tool in 
existence today.
