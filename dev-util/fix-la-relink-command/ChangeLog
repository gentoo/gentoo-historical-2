*fix-la-relink-command-0.1 (26 May 2012)

  26 May 2012; Alexandre Rostovtsev <tetromino@gentoo.org>
  +fix-la-relink-command-0.1.ebuild, +metadata.xml:
  Add a last-resort hack for fixing up relink_command in .la files to prevent
  libraries that are being built from linking to older versions of themselves
  installed in the filesystem. Needed e.g. for evolution-data-server and
  libxml2. Derived from a script used in the evolution-data-server ebuild, and
  therefore keyworded on arches where evolution-data-server itself is
  keyworded.
