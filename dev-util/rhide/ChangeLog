*rhide-1.5 (22 Mar 2003)

  09 May 2003; Martin Holzer <mholzer@gentoo.org> rhide-1.5.ebuild:
  Fixed setedit source.

  22 Mar 2003; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> rhide-1.5 :
  New version with new hacks.  I really wish these guys would try to get
  a more sane build system.  Got the beast to work with rhtvision-2.0.1
  and setedit-0.5.0 ... although setedit's docs currently do not build
  with texinfo-4.5.  No train smach, as we still have info pages.

  22 Sep 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> rhide-1.5_pre-r1 :

  with gcc-3.1 and later.

  New version of rhide!!  This one should actually merge again :P  Lots
  of cleanups to my original ebuild.
