*radare-1.2.1 (12 Feb 2009)

  12 Feb 2009; Ioannis Aslanidis <iaslanidis@gentoo.org> metadata.xml,
  +radare-1.2.1.ebuild:
  Version bump. Parallel build is bogus and creates race conditions. Created a
  local use flag to optionally build the gui. Currently there are a few missing
  dependencies that need to be fixed sooner or later for the gui to work
  properly.

*radare-0.9.9 (31 Jul 2008)

  31 Jul 2008; Ioannis Aslanidis <deathwing00@gentoo.org> +metadata.xml,
  +radare-0.9.9.ebuild:
  Initial version for testing purposes requested by upstream.
