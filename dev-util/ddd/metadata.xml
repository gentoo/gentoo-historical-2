GNU DDD is a graphical front-end for command-line debuggers such as GDB, DBX,
WDB, Ladebug, JDB, XDB, the Perl debugger, the bash debugger, or the Python
debugger. Besides ``usual'' front-end features such as viewing source texts, DDD
has become famous through its interactive graphical data display, where data
structures are displayed as graphs.
