  Beta2. You know you love it.

  11 May 2004; Peter Johanson <latexer@gentoo.org> monodevelop-0.3-r1.ebuild,
  monodevelop-0.3.ebuild:
  Downgrading the icu dependancy to 2.6, as tberman affirms that this really
  will work. (And thus not create problems for gtk-sharp as it seems to like
  icu-2.6 better)

  05 May 2004; Peter Johanson <latexer@gentoo.org> monodevelop-0.3.ebuild:
  And then there was 0.3. mono-debugger support disabled for this release. Will
  be back in 0.4.

*monodevelop-0.2 (01 Apr 2004)

  01 Apr 2004; Peter Johanson <latexer@gentoo.org> metadata.xml,
  monodevelop-0.2.ebuild:
  Initial commit. Everyone rejoice, monodevelop is revealed unto the world.
  Thanks to tberman and the whole mono crew. Thanks to everyone on bug #43816
  as well.
