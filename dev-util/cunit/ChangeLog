*cunit-1.0.0.6 (13 Apr 2002)

  13 Apr 2002; Karl Trygve Kalleberg <karltk@gentoo.org> cunit-1.0.0.6 files/digest-cunit-1.0.0.6 :

  As of now we don't have any light weight unit testing framework for C as it 
  is for C++ (CppUnit) or Java (JUnit). This intiative is taken to provide 
  such a platform independent/version independent core framework and the 
  OS/Environment specific wrappers around them.
