The Eclipse Visual Editor project is a framework for creating GUI builders for
Eclipse.  It will include reference implementations of Swing/JFC and SWT GUI
builders, but intends to be useful for creating GUI builders for other languages
such as C/C++ and alternate widget sets, including those that are not supported
under Java.
