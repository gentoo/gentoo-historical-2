  initial release (#12633)
  ebuild submitted by Tom <Eckert.Thomas@gmx.net>.
  shc is a compiler/scrambler for interpreter-languages. As long as the
  interpreter can read it's script from the command-line you can use shc
  to hide your code -- well this is not very open-source like, but
  sometimes this may be wanted. The main-target was shell-code.
