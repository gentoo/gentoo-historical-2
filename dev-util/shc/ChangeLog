*shc-3.4.ebuild (05 Jan 2003)

  05 Jan 2003; George Shapovalov <george@gentoo.org> ChangeLog, shc-3.4.ebuild, files/digest-shc-3.4 :
  initial release (#12633)
  ebuild submitted by Tom <Eckert.Thomas@gmx.net>.
  shc is a compiler/scrambler for interpreter-languages. As long as the
  interpreter can read it's script from the command-line you can use shc
  to hide your code -- well this is not very open-source like, but
  sometimes this may be wanted. The main-target was shell-code.
