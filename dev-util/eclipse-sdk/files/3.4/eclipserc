# This file specifies some initial Eclipse settings, like memory allowed to Eclipse.
# These settings only affect Eclipse startup and overall configuration.
# Main Eclipse configuration should be done within Eclipse (with the GUI).

# Following variables controls the minimal and maximum amounts of memory
# allocated to Eclipse (respectively).
# Increase those numbers if you get OutOfMemory errors or if you have lots of memory to
# throw at Eclipse.

ECLIPSE_XMS=128m
ECLIPSE_XMX=256m

# Following variables controls the minimal and maximum amounts of memory
# allocated to the permanent generation space.
# This space contains data related to all classes.
# The default values should be enough for most people, but you can increase those amounts
# if you get crashes related to OutOfMemory in PermGen exceptions.
# If you lack memory, you can also try decrease those amounts.

ECLIPSE_PERMSIZE=128m
ECLIPSE_MAX_PERMSIZE=256m
