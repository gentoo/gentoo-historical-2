*eclipse-sdk-2.1 (30 Jun 2003)

  30 Jun 2003; Karl Trygve Kalleberg <karltk@gentoo.org>
  eclipse-sdk-2.1.ebuild, files/eclipse.desktop:
  Initial import. Note that a binary ebuild for Eclipse also exists, as
  eclipse-sdk-bin. This ebuild will eventually try to build all of Eclipse 
  from sources. For now, it only builds the basic platform, and none of the
  GTK+ stuff.
