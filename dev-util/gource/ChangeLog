*gource-0.24_p20100126 (31 Jan 2010)

  31 Jan 2010; Diego E. Petten√≤ <flameeyes@gentoo.org>
  +gource-0.24_p20100126.ebuild, +metadata.xml:
  Initial import of the VCS visualisation tool Gource. It's a snapshot
  ebuild contributed by Enrico Tagliavini, to use the new autotools-based
  build system (written by me, merged upstream), to keep in line with QA
  policies. Also thanks to the indipendent writer Stanislav Cymbalov in bug
  #297074.
