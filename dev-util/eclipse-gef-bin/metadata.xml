The Graphical Editing Framework (GEF) allows developers to create a rich
graphical editor from an existing application model. GEF uses the SWT-based
drawing plugin Draw2d to create a graphical environment within Eclipse. The
developer can then take advantage of the many common operations provided in GEF
and/or extend them for the specific domain. GEF employs an MVC
(model-view-controller) architecture which enables simple changes to be applied
to the model from the view. 

GEF is completely application neutral and provides the groundwork to build
almost any application, including but not limited to: flow builders, GUI
builders, UML diagram editors (such as work-flow and class modeling diagrams),
and even WYSIWYG text editors like HTML.
