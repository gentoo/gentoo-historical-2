The Community Edition is fully usable for modeling UML, and you may use it for any purpose, commercial or not, for any duration and in any number. It contains all UML diagrams and all implemented diagram elements. You can create, save, and load projects, browse existing models, exchange models, generate Java code, export your diagrams to various formats and much more. You may freely distribute it, put it on local or Internet servers, and distribute it on CDs or DVDs. Gentleware does not provide support for the Community Edition.

Generally speaking, the Community Edition provides everything you need to learn and to use UML at a non-professional level. However, there are some restrictions. A few features are available in the commercial editions but not in the free Community Edition.

These features are nice to have in order to increase your productivity, but are not necessary to build UML models. Perhaps most importantly, the Community Edition does not support reverse or round-trip engineering, and it cannot load plug-ins. The Community Edition also does not support printing, copy and paste to the Windows clipboard (to copy diagrams to Word or Powerpoint for example), and the zoom is restricted. The other Editions meet the requirements of professional users.
