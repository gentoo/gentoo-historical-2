  18 Aug 2003; Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org> calendar-1.3u.ebuild:
  Mark stable on alpha and x86

  11 Aug 2003; Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org> :
  Update from author: "Sorry, I was very busy. I'm glad to your invitation.
  Please include it. Thanks."  I assume this means that the choice of the
  vim license is sufficient.

*calendar-1.3u (11 Aug 2003)

  11 Aug 2003; Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org> calendar-1.3u.ebuild,
  metadata.xml:
  Initial import of app-vim/calendar. Attempted to contact the author regarding
  the license of this plugin, but was unsuccessful so far. Considering the file
  bears no copyright or license information, and the file is freely available
  from vim.org, assuming the vim license is sufficient until otherwise informed.
