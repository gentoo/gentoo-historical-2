  25 Apr 2004; Wout Mertens <wmertens@gentoo.org> cream-0.29.ebuild:
  Version Bump.
  Changed the ebuild to use the install script, for upwards maintainability.
  Note that the cream.sh executable was missing in CVS for 0.28, but it's
  not necessary any more.
  Patched creamrc so mkdirs also work under Unix.
  Marking stable because the previous one didn't work for me and this one
  does, and no stable version is available.

  16 Mar 2004; David Holm <dholm@gentoo.org> cream-0.28.ebuild:
  Added to ~ppc.

  15 Mar 2004; Ciaran McCreesh <ciaranm@gentoo.org> cream-0.28.ebuild:
  Stable on sparc, added ~mips

*cream-0.28 (07 Feb 2004)
