  30 Mar 2004; Michael Sterrett <mr_bones_@gentoo.org> generator-0.35.ebuild:
  don't rdepend on nasm; "use arch" instead of "ARCH == "

  20 Mar 2004; Michael Sterrett <mr_bones_@gentoo.org> generator-0.35.ebuild,
  files/logging.patch, files/netbsd-gcc-3.3.patch:
  ripped off the patches from netbsd for generator to get the logging working
  again.

  20 Mar 2004; Michael Sterrett <mr_bones_@gentoo.org> generator-0.35.ebuild:
  fix bug #44709 by turning off logging
  fixed up old hard-coded gcc flags in configure
  take out mention of allegro and tcltk - this package looks dead upstream so
  it doesn't look like allegro and tcltk will ever be supported.
  changed make to emake -j1 - don't even think about trying to use parallel
  make with these makefiles - very broken

  20 Dec 2003; David Holm <dholm@gentoo.org> generator-0.35.ebuild:
  Added a small ppc fix and added to ~ppc.

*generator-0.35 (15 Jul 2003)

  15 Jul 2003; Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org> :
  Initial import.  Ebuild submitted by me for #20818.
