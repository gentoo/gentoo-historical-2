  15 Mar 2003; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> gvim-6.1-r7.ebuild :

  Version bumpd by ryan phillips <rphillips@gentoo.org>.

  Now, the gvim specific patches are applied in src_unpack in the ebuild.
  Note that in the gentoo patches tarball, there are subdirectories:

  patches-all; patches-vim-core; patches-vim; and patches-gvim.  Each
  ebuild can specify which (conditional) patches to apply, and those
  patches should be placed in the correct subdirectory.  Common patches go
  into the patches-all subdirectory

  13 Mar 2003; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> gvim-6.1-r6.ebuild :

  First, removed the crusty ebuilds from here.  Second, just set the
  EGUI_ENABLE variable to "yes" and the eclass will handle everything.
  This and the vim ebuilds are too similar to have these big ebuild files,
  so a nice centralised location -- the eclass -- is desirable.  The patch
  was shared with vim (and both had them in files/ which is duplication
  and just bad style, really). The patchball has been moved off to the
  mirrors  (see vim's ChangeLog for patch creating guidelines).
