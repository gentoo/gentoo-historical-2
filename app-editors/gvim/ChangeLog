*<PACKAGE_NAME>-<PACKAGE_VERSION>-<PACKAGE_RELEASE> (DD MMM YYYY)

  DD MMM YYYY; YOUR_NAME <YOUR_EMAIL> changed_file1, changed_file2: Initial
  import. Ebuild submitted by submitter_name <submitter_email>.  Note that the
  "changed_file" listing is optional if you are simply bumping the rev of the
  ebuild and are only making changes to the .ebuild file itself.  Also note
  that we now have a single unified paragraph rather than having the first line
  separated from the rest by a newline.  Everything should be in one block like
  this. (note by drobbins, 16 Jul 2002)

  DD MMM YYYY; YOUR_NAME <YOUR_EMAIL> changed_file1, changed_file2: this is
  an earlier ChangeLog enty.
 
-- Explanation of ChangeLog format:

  This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the comments should be
  well explained and written in clean English.
 
  Every new version or revision of the package should be marked by a '*'
  seperator line as above. Changes since the last revision have to be added to
  the top of the file, underneath the initial copyright and cvs header
  comments, in exactly the same format as this comment.
  
  This means that you start with header line that has the following format,
  indented two spaces:
  
  DD MMM YYYY; your_name <your_email> changed_file1, changed_file2: Your
  explanation should follow. It should be indented and wrapped at a line width
  of 80 characters.  The changed_files can be omitted if they are obvious; for
  example, if you are only modifying the .ebuild file and committing a new rev
  of a package.  Any details about what exactly changed in the code should be
  added as a message when the changes are committed to cvs, not in this file.

-- A word regarding credit:

  Please add credit information ("ebuild submitted by ...", "patch submitted
  by ...") to the ChangeLog. Do not add this information to the ebuilds
  themselves.

  And remember: Give credit where credit is due. We're all doing this for
  free, so the best we can hope (and expect!) to receive is credit.
