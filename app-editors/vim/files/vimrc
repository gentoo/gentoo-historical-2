" Default configuration file for Vim
" Written by Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org>

" The following are some sensible defaults for Vim for most users.  We attempt
" to change as little as possible from Vim's defaults, deviating only where it
" really makes sense.
set nocompatible        " Use Vim defaults (much better!)
set backspace=2         " allow backspacing over everything in insert mode
set autoindent          " always set autoindenting on
set ruler               " show the cursor position all the time

" added to default to high security within Gentoo. Fixes #14088

set modelines=0

" Vim beeps in gnome-terminals when trying to fetch the terminal version.
" This is really a bug in gnome-terminal (I think), but we can workaround it
" with the following code.
if &term =~ "xterm"
	set t_RV=           " don't check terminal version
endif

if has("autocmd")

" Gentoo-specific settings for ebuilds.  These are the federally-mandated
" required tab settings.  See the following for more information:
