*vim-6.2_pre1 (23 Apr 2003)

  24 Apr 2003; Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org> :
  Update digests

  23 Apr 2003; Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org> vim-6.1-r19.ebuild,
  vim-6.1-r20.ebuild, vim-6.1-r21.ebuild, vim-6.2_pre1.ebuild:
  Update all ebuilds to work with new eclass. Add version 6.2a. Disable linking
  against X libraries (see bug 19115).

*vim-6.1-r21 (22 Mar 2003)

  16 Apr 2003; Guy Martin <gmsoft@gentoo.org> vim-6.1-r21.ebuild :
  Marked stable on hppa.
  
  02 Apr 2003; Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org> vim-6.1-r21.ebuild:

  Added sparc stable keyword

  22 Mar 2003; Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org> vim-6.1-r21.ebuild:
  Move vimrc to vim-core since it applies to both vim and gvim. 
  Update to patchlevel 411.  Mark stable on x86, alpha.  Remove
  EXCLUDE_PATCHES crutch since it's no longer needed by the eclass.  The
  eclass now snoops the patches to determine what is relevant instead of using
  the README.  Create vim->gvim and vi->vim symlinks when there's no conflict.

*vim-6.1-r20.ebuild (13 Mar 2003)

  13 Mar 2003; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> vim-6.1-r20.ebuild
  files/vimrc vim-6.1-r19.ebuild :

  OK, the vim.eclass was massively overhauled.  It handles, unpack,
  compile, install and postinst functions now.  Additionally, the patches
  have been moved out of portage and onto the mirrors instead.  They are
  also named better (vim-6.1-gentoo-patches.tar.bz2).  The vim.org patches
  are in vim-6.1-patches-001-390 for this -r20.  For future releases,
  please just take the patches in that and add your own.  The vim.eclass
  should filter out Windows, Mac, BC5 and VMS only patches automatically,
  but if you experience failures in patches, please list the patch's
  number in PATCH_EXCLUDES in the ebuild.  Additionally, for the vim.org
  patches, please gzip them before creating the patch-tarball.  The
  VIMPATCH variable now only contains the number of the highest patch in
  the tarball (so "390" for the -r20 release). Note that the vim.eclass
  also handles gvim installs.  The vimrc here is now a combination of the
  original gentoo vimrc and the redhat vimrc.  This should make for a
  better looking vim session, at any rate, though the colours could stand
  to change.

  29 Jul 2002; Ryan Phillips <rphillips@gentoo.org> vim-6.1-r9.ebuild

  Updated patches. The patches no longer take tons of space in portage.

vim-6.1-r8.ebuild (06 Jul 2002)
  	
  15 Jul 2002; Owen Stampflee <owen@gentoo.org> :

  Added KEYWORDS.

  06 Jul 2002; Michael Nazaroff <naz@gentoo.org> vim-6.1-r8.ebuild :

  Added back gpm support, since gpm should now be fixed. I also added a
  addpredict line to hopefully remove those sandbox violations we where
  occasionally getting.  Also added a few more misc patch's. I also added
  LICENSE lines to all of the ebuilds.

*vim-6.1-r7 (27 May 2002)

  27 May 2002; Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org> vim-6.1-r7.ebuild :

*vim-6.1-r6 (19 May 2002)

  19 May 2002; Ryan Phillips <rphillips@gentoo.org> vim-6.1-r6.ebuild :

  Added more patches to files/

*vim-6.1-r5 (30 Apr 2002)

  30 Apr 2002; Ryan Phillips <rphillips@gentoo.org> vim-6.1-r5.ebuild :

  NLS will enable multibyte support now.  I don't see a problem with
  this...

  30 Apr 2002; Ryan Phillips <rphillips@gentoo.org> vim-6.1-r5.ebuild :

  Included patches for 6.1 in the files/ directory.

*vim-6.1-r4 (15 Apr 2002)

  15 Apr 2002; Jared H. Hudson <jhhudso@gentoo.org> vim-6.1-r4.ebuild :

  Replaced --enable-max-features with --with-features=huge
  --enable-max-features was the old, 5.0 way to enable all features.
  6.0+ uses --with-features=tiny,small,normal,big or huge
  This fixes bug #1597
  
*vim-6.1-r3 (9 Apr 2002)

  9 Apr 2002; M.Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> :

  I havent looked at 6.0, but it seems that in 6.1, $VIMRUNTIME is not
  set in the Makefiles, and thus vim cant find its syntax files, etc. It
  works for me ... Aron Griffis, please verify, and fix if it is not the
  correct method.  Resolved by creating /etc/env.d/40vim in src_install().

*vim-6.1-r2 (7 Apr 2002)

  7 Apr 2002; Jared H. Hudson <jhhudso@gentoo.org> vim-6.1-r2.ebuild :

  Removed "addpredict /dev/vc/" from ebuild, portage-1.8.17 now
  includes /dev/vc/ in sandbox as a default writable directory,
  as it did with /dev/pts/ before 1.8.17.

*vim-6.1-r1 (4 Apr 2002)

  4 Apr 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> vim-6.1-r1.ebuild :

  This is a dirty hack, in my opinion, to bypass the sandbox violation
  errors on the /dev/vc/*.  I think this is a portage bug more than
  a vim  bug because it happens for new to 1.0 users.

*vim-6.1 (30 Mar 2002)

  30 Mar 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> vim-6.1.ebuild

  Resolved bug 1426: SRC_URI points primarily to ftp.vim.org instead
  of ftp.us.vim.org which no longer contains the tar ball for 6.1
  Thanks to jnelson@jamponi.net

*vim-6.1 (26 Mar 2002)

  26 Mar 2002; Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org> vim-6.0-r6.ebuild, vim-6.1.ebuild:

  Resolved bug 1335: vim 6.1 released
  Resolved bug 1293: vim python support disabled

*vim-6.0-r5 (19 Feb 2002)

  19 Feb 2002; Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org> vim-6.0-r5.ebuild:

  Resolved bug 583: "patch to vim-6.0-r4 to install a vimrc in
  /usr/share/vim instead of /etc/skel/.vimrc".  Additionally install
  a default, reasonable gvimrc.  Updated vim to 6.0.223 with all
  available patches.

*vim-6.0-r4 (1 Feb 2002)

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :

  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that
  the comments should well explained and written in clean English. The
  details about writing correct changelogs are explained in the
  skel.ChangeLog file which you can find in the root directory of the
  portage repository.
