  29 Jul 2002; Ryan Phillips <rphillips@gentoo.org> vim-6.1-r9.ebuild 
  and patches :

  Updated patches. The patches no longer take tons of space in portage.

vim-6.1-r8.ebuild (06 Jul 2002)
		
  15 Jul 2002; Owen Stampflee <owen@gentoo.org> :

  Added KEYWORDS.

	06 Jul 2002; Michael Nazaroff <naz@gentoo.org> vim-6.1-r8.ebuild :

	Added back gpm support, since gpm should now be fixed. I also added a
	addpredict line to hopefully remove those sandbox violations we where
	occasionally getting.  Also added a few more misc patch's. I also added
	LICENSE lines to all of the ebuilds.

*vim-6.1-r7 (27 May 2002)

	27 May 2002; Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org> vim-6.1-r7.ebuild :

	Removed gpm support to close bug #1808.

*vim-6.1-r6 (19 May 2002)

	19 May 2002; Ryan Phillips <rphillips@gentoo.org> vim-6.1-r6.ebuild :

	Added more patches to files/

*vim-6.1-r5 (30 Apr 2002)

	30 Apr 2002; Ryan Phillips <rphillips@gentoo.org> vim-6.1-r5.ebuild :

	NLS will enable multibyte support now.  I don't see a problem with
	this...

	30 Apr 2002; Ryan Phillips <rphillips@gentoo.org> vim-6.1-r5.ebuild :

	Included patches for 6.1 in the files/ directory.

*vim-6.1-r4 (15 Apr 2002)

	15 Apr 2002; Jared H. Hudson <jhhudso@gentoo.org> vim-6.1-r4.ebuild :

	Replaced --enable-max-features with --with-features=huge
	--enable-max-features was the old, 5.0 way to enable all features.
	6.0+ uses --with-features=tiny,small,normal,big or huge
	This fixes bug #1597
	
*vim-6.1-r3 (9 Apr 2002)

	9 Apr 2002; M.Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> :

	I havent looked at 6.0, but it seems that in 6.1, $VIMRUNTIME is not
	set in the Makefiles, and thus vim cant find its syntax files, etc. It
	works for me ... Aron Griffis, please verify, and fix if it is not the
	correct method.  Resolved by creating /etc/env.d/40vim in src_install().

*vim-6.1-r2 (7 Apr 2002)

	7 Apr 2002; Jared H. Hudson <jhhudso@gentoo.org> vim-6.1-r2.ebuild :

	Removed "addpredict /dev/vc/" from ebuild, portage-1.8.17 now
	includes /dev/vc/ in sandbox as a default writable directory,
	as it did with /dev/pts/ before 1.8.17.

*vim-6.1-r1 (4 Apr 2002)

	4 Apr 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> vim-6.1-r1.ebuild :

	This is a dirty hack, in my opinion, to bypass the sandbox violation
	errors on the /dev/vc/*.  I think this is a portage bug more than
	a vim  bug because it happens for new to 1.0 users.

*vim-6.1 (30 Mar 2002)

	30 Mar 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> vim-6.1.ebuild

	Resolved bug 1426: SRC_URI points primarily to ftp.vim.org instead
	of ftp.us.vim.org which no longer contains the tar ball for 6.1
	Thanks to jnelson@jamponi.net

*vim-6.1 (26 Mar 2002)

	26 Mar 2002; Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org> vim-6.0-r6.ebuild, vim-6.1.ebuild:

	Resolved bug 1335: vim 6.1 released
	Resolved bug 1293: vim python support disabled

*vim-6.0-r5 (19 Feb 2002)

	19 Feb 2002; Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org> vim-6.0-r5.ebuild:

	Resolved bug 583: "patch to vim-6.0-r4 to install a vimrc in
	/usr/share/vim instead of /etc/skel/.vimrc".  Additionally install
	a default, reasonable gvimrc.  Updated vim to 6.0.223 with all
	available patches.

*vim-6.0-r4 (1 Feb 2002)

	1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :

	Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
	updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that
	the comments should well explained and written in clean English. The
	details about writing correct changelogs are explained in the
	skel.ChangeLog file which you can find in the root directory of the
	portage repository.
