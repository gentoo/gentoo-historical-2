  29 Jun 2013; Tom Wijsman <TomWij@gentoo.org> +retext-4.0.1-r1.ebuild,
  +retext-9999.ebuild:
  Revision bump. Made symlink from /usr/bin/retext to /usr/bin/retext.py. Made
  sure locales are respected by removing disabled locales. Removed unnecessary
  inherit. Added live 9999 ebuild for testing purposes.

*retext-4.0.1 (29 Jun 2013)

  29 Jun 2013; Tom Wijsman <TomWij@gentoo.org> +metadata.xml,
  +retext-4.0.1.ebuild:
  New ebuild for app-editors/retext, a Qt-based text editor for Markdown and
  reStructuredText. Fixes bug #445614, original ebuild by Manuel RÃ¼ger (mrueg),
  adjusted by Johann Schmitz and some small changes by me.
