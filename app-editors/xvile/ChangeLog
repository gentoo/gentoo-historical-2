  22 Dec 2002; Michael Cummings <mcummings@gentoo.org> xvile-9.3h.ebuild:

  Many thanks go to jbooth (jbooth@uiuc.edu) in bug 12469 for this
  ebuild. This version of vile will work with perl 5.8, where the
  previous versions would not. Will unmask for x86 when perl 5.8 is
  unmasked.

*xvile-9.2r (1 Feb 2002)
