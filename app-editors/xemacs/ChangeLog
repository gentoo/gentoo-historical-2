*xemacs-21.4.6; (14 Feb 2002)

  14 Feb 2002; Arcady Genkin <agenkin@thpoon.com> xemacs-21.4.6.ebuild :

   - Created ebuild for 21.4.6 (gamma version).
   - Updated versions of efs and base elisp packages.
   - Changed default download URL to "http://ftp.us.xemacs.org/..."
     because ftp://ftp.xemacs.org is always overloaded and slow.
   - Added media-libs/compface as a dependency and added
     --with-x-face to configure options.
