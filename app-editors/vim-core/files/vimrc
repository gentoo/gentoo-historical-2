" Default configuration file for Vim
" Written by Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org>
" Modified by Ryan Phillips <rphillips@gentoo.org>
" Added Redhat's vimrc info by Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org>

" The following are some sensible defaults for Vim for most users.
" We attempt to change as little as possible from Vim's defaults,
" deviating only where it makes sense
set nocompatible        " Use Vim defaults (much better!)
set bs=2                " Allow backspacing over everything in insert mode
set ai                  " Always set auto-indenting on
"set backup             " Keep a backup file
set viminfo='20,\"500   " read/write a .viminfo file -- limit regs to 500 lines
set history=50          " keep 50 lines of command history
set ruler               " Show the cursor position all the time

" Added to default to high security within Gentoo. Fixes bug #14088.
