  JOE (Joe's own editor) has the feel of most IBM PC text editors: The
  key-sequences are reminiscent of WordStar and Turbo-C. JOE is much more
  powerful than those editors, however. JOE has all of the features a UNIX
  user should expect: full use of termcap/terminfo, excellent screen update
  optimizations, simple installation, and all of the UNIX-integration features
  of VI.
