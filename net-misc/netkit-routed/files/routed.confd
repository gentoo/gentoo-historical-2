# Normally routed is simply run as "/usr/sbin/routed".  Set this
# option to run routed with additional parameters, for example:
#
#   -d  Enable additional debugging information
#   -s  Force routed to supply routing information
#   -q  Opposite of the -s option
#
# Additional options are listed in the routed(8) manual page.
#
# Our default configuration is to run quietly, i.e. don't publish
# routes.  This is to keep from catching users unaware since routed
# will publish routes if there's more than one interface configured on
# the machine.
