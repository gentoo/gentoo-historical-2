*tightvnc-1.2.3 (25 March 2002)

  25 March 2002; Bart Verwilst <verwilst@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :

  Upgraded to 1.2.3, and removed the old 2 versions..
  Since 1.2.2 never compiled, the TightVNC people assured me 1.2.3
  fixes all the problems, and it does! :o) So we have a fully working 
  version for Gentoo 1.0 :o)

*tightvnc-1.2.1 (1 Feb 2002)

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
  
  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
