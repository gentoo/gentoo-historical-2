<longdescription>strongSwan is an OpenSource IPsec implementation for the Linux operating system. It is based on the discontinued FreeS/WAN project and the X.509 patch which we developed over the last three years. In order to have a stable IPsec platform to base our future extensions of the X.509 capability on, we decided to lauch the strongSwan project.</longdescription>
