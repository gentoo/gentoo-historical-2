		strongSwan is an OpenSource IPsec implementation for the Linux
		operating system. It is based on the discontinued FreeS/WAN project and
		the X.509 patch which we developed over the last three years. In order
		to have a stable IPsec platform to base our future extensions of the
		X.509 capability on, we decided to lauch the strongSwan project.
