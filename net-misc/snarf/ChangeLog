  01 Aug 2003; Tavis Ormandy <taviso@gentoo.org> snarf-7.0-r2.ebuild,
  files/snarf-basename-patch.diff, files/snarf-unlink-empty.diff:
  Adding a new ebuild that contains two new patches i've created, 
  a patch that unlinks empty files (essential for developer use with 
  snarf as a FETCHCOMMAND), and a patch that adds a -b/-B option to 
  only display the basename of the output, useful for use with 
  FETCHCOMMAND.
