*rp-l2tp-0.3-r1 (05 Apr 2003)

  05 Apr 2003; Donny Davies <woodchip@gentoo.org> rp-l2tp-0.3-r1.ebuild,
  rp-l2tp-0.3.ebuild, files/rp-l2tpd-init:
  Old patch had `$Id:' tag which got munged when committed to CVS.  This
  one has the patchfile on the mirrors instead so it'll apply properly.

*rp-l2tp-0.3 (24 Feb 2003)

  24 Feb 2003; Donny Davies <woodchip@gentoo.org> :
  Initial import, created by me.
