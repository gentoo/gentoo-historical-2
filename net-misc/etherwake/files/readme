	This program generates and transmits a Wake-On-LAN (WOL) "Magic Packet",
	used for restarting machines that have been soft-powered-down
	(ACPI D3-warm state).  It currently generates the standard AMD Magic Packet
	format, with an optional password appended.

  Notes:
  On some systems dropping root capability allows the process to be
  dumped, traced or debugged.
  If someone traces this program, they get control of a raw socket.
  Linux handles this safely, but beware when porting this program.

  An alternative to needing 'root' is using a UDP broadcast socket, however
  doing so only works with adapters configured for unicast+broadcast Rx
  filter.  That configuration consumes more power.
