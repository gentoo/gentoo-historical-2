  27 Dec 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> :

  16 Dec 2002; Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org> :
  Unified the previous set of /etc files (a) with the current set (b) and

*ntp-4.1.1a (1 May 2002)
  1 May 2002; Jon Nelson <jnelson@gentoo.org> ntp-4.1.72-r2.ebuild :
  Create 4.1.1a ebuild and mask 4.1.72* versions, the 4.1.72* versions
  are *alpha* releases for 4.2.0, and have trouble building on some
  hosts.
  
  This should finally close 1882

*ntp-4.1.72-r2 (28 Apr 2002)
  28 Apr 2002; Jon Nelson <jnelson@gentoo.org> ntp-4.1.72-r2.ebuild :

  Remove -lncurses from LDFLAGS environment, it screws up
  the build.
  If there is a good reason for it to be there, prefix it with
   -L/lib so that configure can find it there (it's not in /usr/lib).
  Closes bug #1882 and allows compilation
  Update ebuild for lintool compliance
  
*ntp-4.1.72-r1 (24 March 2002)

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
  
  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
