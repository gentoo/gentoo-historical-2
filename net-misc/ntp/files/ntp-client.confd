# Command to run to set the clock initially
# Most people should just leave this line alone ...
# however, if you know what you're doing, and you
# want to use ntpd to set the clock, change this to 'ntpd'

# Options to pass to the above command
# Most people should just uncomment this variable and
# change 'someserver' to a valid hostname which you
# can aquire from the URL's below
NTPCLIENT_OPTS="-Q -b pool.ntp.org"

# How long to wait (in seconds) before giving up.
# Useful for when you boot and DNS/internet isn't
# really available but you have your net interface
# come up with say a static IP.
