# NOTES:
#  - you should only have to update the server line below
#  - if you start getting lines like 'restrict' and 'fudge'
#    and you didnt add them, AND you run dhcpcd on your
#    network interfaces, be sure to add '-Y -N' to the
#    dhcpcd_ethX variables in /etc/conf.d/net

# Name of the servers ntpd should sync with
# Please respect the access policy as stated by the responsible person.
#server		ntp.example.tld		iburst

##
# A list of available servers is available here:
# http://www.eecis.udel.edu/~mills/ntp/servers.html
# Please follow the rules of engagement and use a
# Stratum 2 server (unless you qualify for Stratum 1)
##

# you should not need to modify the following paths
logfile		/var/log/ntpd.log
driftfile	/var/lib/ntp/ntp.drift

#server ntplocal.example.com prefer 
#server timeserver.example.org 

# Warning: Using default NTP settings will leave your NTP
# server accessible to all hosts on the Internet.

# If you want to deny all machines (including your own)
# from accessing the NTP server, uncomment:
#
#restrict default ignore


# To only deny other machines from changing the
# configuration but allow localhost uncomment:
#
#restrict default notrust nomodify
#restrict 127.0.0.1


# To allow machines within your network to synchronize
# their clocks with your server, but ensure they are
# not allowed to configure the server or used as peers
# to synchronize against, uncomment this line.

#restrict 192.168.1.0 mask 255.255.255.0 notrust nomodify notrap
