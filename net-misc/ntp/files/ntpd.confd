# NOTES:
#  - NTPDATE variables below are used if you wish to set your
#    clock when you start the ntp init.d script
#  - make sure that the NTPDATE_CMD will close by itself ...
#    the init.d script will not attempt to kill/stop it
#  - ntpd will be used to maintain synchronization with a time
#    server regardless of what NTPDATE is set to
#  - read each of the comments above each of the variable

# Comment this out if you dont want the init script to warn
# about not having ntpdate setup
NTPDATE_WARN="y"

# Command to run to set the clock initially
# Most people should just uncomment this line ...
# however, if you know what you're doing, and you
# want to use ntpd to set the clock, change this to 'ntpd'
#NTPDATE_CMD="ntpdate"

# Options to pass to the above command
# Most people should just uncomment this variable and
# change 'someserver' to a valid hostname which you
# can aquire from the URL's below
#NTPDATE_OPTS="-b someserver"
