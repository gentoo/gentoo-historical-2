	Netcomics is a program that downloads today's comic strips
	from the Web, and places them in a local directory where they can be
	retrieved for display. Because each website that carries comic strips
	chooses how old of strips to show, the comic strips downloaded will
	actually be from different dates, but they'll always be the latest.
