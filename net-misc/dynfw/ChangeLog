*dynfw-1.0.1 (29 Apr 2002)

  06 Jul 2002; phoen][x <phoenix@gentoo.org> dynfw-1.0.1.ebuild :
  Added KEYWORDS, LICENSE, SLOT.

  29 Apr 2002; William McArthur <sandymac@gentoo.org> dynfw-1.0.1.ebuild :
  The install.sh didn't support installing to a image directory so I copied most
  of the install.sh file into src_install and manually tweaked what was needed.
