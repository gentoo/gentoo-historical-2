*tsocks-1.8beta4  (10 Jun 2002)

  10 Jun 2002; Ben Lutgens <lamer@gentoo.org> tsocks-1.8_beta4: Ebuild for
  tsocks submitted to bugs.gentoo.org by a gentoo user *THANKS*
  bardur-gta@odense.kollegienet.dk. It should be noted that as per the
  install docs, this stuff gets installed to /lib. Mainly due to the fact
  that it's often needed before /usr gets mounted. So the old
  /etc/ld.so.preload trick won't work!
