This program tries to prevent unauthorized usage of IPs within the local
ethernet broadcastdomain by giving an answer to ARP-requests. After receiving
such a faked reply, the requesting party stores the told MAC in its ARP-table
and will send future packets to this MAC. Because this MAC is invalid, the host
with the invalid IP can not be reached.
