Allow FXO channels to send out calls even before someone calls in through 
them.

This rxisoffhook does not work. Before 1.6.0 it was wrapped in a #ifdef
DAHDI_CHECK_HOOKSTATE (or rather: ZAP_CHECK_HOOKSTATE). In 1.6 it is 
accidentally enabled by default.

On DAHDI (the kernel) this field is not properly initialized at startup. 
And thus it will only work after an incoming ring.
