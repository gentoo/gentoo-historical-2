# /etc/conf.d/dhcp: config file for /etc/init.d/dhcp

# Configure which interface or interfaces to for dhcp to listen on
# list all interfaces space separated. If this is not specified then
# we listen on all interfaces.
#IFACE=""

# Insert any other dhcp options - see the man page for a full list.
#DHCPD_OPTS=""

# If you wish to run dhcp in a chroot, run:
# ebuild /var/db/pkg/net-misc/<dhcp version>/<dhcp-version>.ebuild config
# and un-comment the following line.
# You can specify a different chroot directory but MAKE SURE it's empty.
#CHROOT="/chroot/dhcp"

# If you need name resolution under a chroot, you need to ensure that
# you have a working /etc/resolv.conf in your chroot and you
# uncomment the following:
#export LD_PRELOAD="/usr/lib/libresolv.so /usr/lib/libnss_dns.so"
