DESCRIPTION="the standalone host tool, supports LOC reporting (RFC1876)"
#this is somewhat old tool, has not been changed since 1999,
#still looks like host from bind does not provide all possible functionality
#at least xtraceroute wants LOC support, which is provided by this tool

SRC_URI="ftp://ftp.ripe.net/tools/dns/${PN}.tar.Z"
HOMEPAGE="http://www.dtek.chalmers.se/~d3august/xt/"
#that's the homepage for xtraceroute, not host, but that's best I can do
#at least it is mentioned there

DEPEND="net-dns/bind-tools"
#either bind or bind-tools will do,
#but since bind-tools is just a partiall install of bind
#there is no point in introducing new use var and doing PROVIDE dance..
