*vnc-3.3.3-r2 (1 Feb 2002)

  09 Jul 2002; phoen][x <phoenix@gentoo.org> vnc-3.3.3-r2.ebuild :
  Added KEYWORDS, LICENSE, SLOT, DESCRIPTION.

  11 Apr 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> vnc-3.3.3-r2.ebuild :
  Added X as a dependency since xmkmf is required for compilation, and that is
  provided by X (and openmotif, but that is pointless).  Also, brought ebuild's
  syntax up to date.  No revision bump necessary.

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :  
  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
