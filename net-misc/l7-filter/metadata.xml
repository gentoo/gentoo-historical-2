  L7-filter is a packet classifier for Linux. Unlike most other classifiers, it
  doesn't just look at simple values such as port numbers. Instead, it does
  regular expression matching on the application layer data to determine what
  protocols are being used. This is kernel version - old and well tested, but it
  is complicated to install and seems to cause SMP systems to crash. It can only
  use fairly simple regular expressions.
