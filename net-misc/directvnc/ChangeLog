  files/digest-directvnc-0.6.1 files/dfb.c :

  Version bump, and the dfb.c from directvnc's CVS, where the API changes

  against portage's version of DirectFB.

*directvnc-0.6 (31 May 2002)

  31 May 2002; Grant Goodyear <g2boojum@gentoo.org> 
  New import.  Note that the stuff in src_unpack (and the automake/
  autoconf dependencies) should go away in the next release, since
  they're only there to fix the author's mistake.
 
-- Explanation of ChangeLog format:
 
  Every new version or revision of the package should be marked by a '*'
  seperator line as above. Changes since the last revision have to be added to
  the top of the file, underneath the initial copyright and cvs header
  comments, in exactly the same format as this comment.
  
  This means that you start with header line that has the following format,
  indented two spaces:
  
  DD MMM YYYY; your_name <your_email> changed_file1, changed_file2: Your
  explanation should follow. It should be indented and wrapped at a line width
  of 80 characters.  The changed_files can be omitted if they are obvious; for
  example, if you are only modifying the .ebuild file and committing a new rev
  of a package.  Any details about what exactly changed in the code should be
  added as a message when the changes are committed to cvs, not in this file.
