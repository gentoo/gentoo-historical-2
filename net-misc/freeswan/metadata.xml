<longdescription>Linux FreeS/WAN is an implementation of IPSEC & IKE for Linux.

IPSEC is Internet Protocol SECurity. It uses strong cryptography to provide both
authentication and encryption services. Authentication ensures that packets are
from the right sender and have not been altered in transit. Encryption prevents
unauthorised reading of packet contents.

These services allow you to build secure tunnels through untrusted networks.
Everything passing through the untrusted net is encrypted by the IPSEC gateway
machine and decrypted by the gateway at the other end. The result is Virtual
Private Network or VPN. This is a network which is effectively private even
though it includes machines at several different sites connected by the insecure
Internet.

The IPSEC protocols were developed by the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force)
and will be required as part of IP Version Six, the next generation. They are
also being widely implemented for IP V4. In particular, nearly all vendors of
any type of firewall or security software have IPSEC support either shipping or
in development. There are also several open source IPSEC projects. Several
companies are co-operating in the Secure Wide Area Network (S/WAN) project to
ensure that products will interoperate. There is also a VPN Consortium fostering
cooperation among companies in this area.

Our project's primary objective is to help make IPSEC widespread by providing
source code which is freely available, runs on a range of machines including
ubiquitous cheap PCs, and is not subject to US or other nations' export restrictions.
