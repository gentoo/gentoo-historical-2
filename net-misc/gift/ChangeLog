*gift-0.10.0_pre020527 (30 May 2002)

  30 May 2002; Bart Verwilst <verwilst@gentoo.org> :

  New cvs snapshot of gift.. I've masked it, and added a big notice that 
  people who want to use it MUST update gift whenever a new version is 
  available, otherwise they'll pollute the network.. I'll be adding a new 
  version every week or so, and remove the older version.

*gift-0.9.7 (1 Feb 2002)

  15 Mar 2002; Grant Goodyear <g2boojum@gentoo.org> :

  Removed at the request of the authors.  This version is horribly
  broken and out of date.
  
*gift-0.9.7 (1 Feb 2002)

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
  
  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
