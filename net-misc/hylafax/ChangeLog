*hylafax-4.1.2 (23 Apr 2002)

  22 Apr 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> hylafax-4.1.2.ebuild
  files/hylafax-4.1.2-gentoo-diffs.tar.bz2 files/digest-hylafax-4.1.2 :

  Updated to newest stable release.  This is a pain to build because it requires
  a lower GNU/sed version than we have in portage.  So, GNU/sed-3.02 is fetched
  and built statically, so that it can be used to configure hylafax.  The
  other patches are taken from Mandrake's srpm for 4.1.1, but seems to work well
  with this.
