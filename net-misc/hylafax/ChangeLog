*hylafax-4.1.2-r1 (24 Apr 2002)

  24 Apr 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> hylafax-4.1.2-r1.ebuild
  files/hylafax-4.1.2-r1-gentoo-diffs.tar.bz2 files/digest-hylafax-4.1.2-r1 :

  Lee Howard <faxguy@deanox.com> from the hylafax-users mailing list informed
  me that drobbins' patch to make the configure script work with sed-3.02.80
  (as posted on hylafax's bugzilla by g2boojum) was a tad incomplete.  He 
  graciously completed it et voila! successful emerge without having to compile
  a static sed-3.02 :)  Many thanks to him.

*hylafax-4.1.2 (23 Apr 2002)

  23 Apr 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> hylafax-4.1.2.ebuild
  files/hylafax-4.1.2-gentoo-diffs.tar.bz2 files/digest-hylafax-4.1.2 :

  Updated to newest stable release.  This is a pain to build because it requires
  a lower GNU/sed version than we have in portage.  So, GNU/sed-3.02 is fetched
  and built statically, so that it can be used to configure hylafax.  The
  other patches are taken from Mandrake's srpm for 4.1.1, but seems to work well
  with this.
