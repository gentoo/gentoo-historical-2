*hylafax-4.1.3 (12 Aug 2002)

  11 Sep 2002; Nick hadaway <raker@gentoo.org> hylafax-4.1.3.ebuild :
  Updated small typo

  27 Aug 2002; Nick Hadaway <raker@gentoo.org> hylafax-4.1.3.ebuild :
  Added fixes to address bug #7058.  Cleaned up the ebuild formatting.
  Corrected license to be freedist.

  15 Aug 2002; Nick Hadaway <raker@gentoo.org> hylafax-4.1.3.ebuild :
  Added /etc/init.d/hylafax permissions fix.

  12 Aug 2002; Nick Hadaway <raker@gentoo.org> hylafax-4.1.3.ebuild,
  files/digest-hylafax-4.1.3 :
  Version bump.  I have removed previous patches from the ebuild
  temporarily until I can figure out which patches are still needed.
  Taken from the release notes:
    4.1.3 includes fixes for a remote format string vulnerability 
    which could be abused in a denial of service attack. Also fixed 
    is a buffer overflow condition when receiving fax image data 
    which potentially could be exploited to execute arbitrary code as 
    root. Also present in 4.1.3 are fixes for several other local remote 
    format string vulnerabilities which, in some installations, could 
    lead to elevated privileges by abuse. Everyone is advised to upgrade.

*hylafax-4.1.2-r1 (24 Apr 2002)

  13 Aug 2002; Nick Hadaway <raker@gentoo.org> hylafax-4.1.2-r1.ebuild ;
  Added "insopts -m 755" so /etc/init.d/hylafax installs with correct
  permissions.

  06 Jul 2002; phoen][x <phoenix@gentoo.org> hylafax-4.1.2-r1.ebuild :
  Added KEYWORDS, LICENSE, SLOT.

  24 Apr 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> hylafax-4.1.2-r1.ebuild
  files/hylafax-4.1.2-r1-gentoo-diffs.tar.bz2 files/digest-hylafax-4.1.2-r1 :

  Lee Howard <faxguy@deanox.com> from the hylafax-users mailing list informed
  me that drobbins' patch to make the configure script work with sed-3.02.80
  (as posted on hylafax's bugzilla by g2boojum) was a tad incomplete.  He 
  graciously completed it et voila! successful emerge without having to compile
  a static sed-3.02 :)  Many thanks to him.

*hylafax-4.1.2 (23 Apr 2002)

  06 Jul 2002; phoen][x <phoenix@gentoo.org> hylafax-4.1.2.ebuild :
  Added KEYWORDS, LICENSE, SLOT.

  23 Apr 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> hylafax-4.1.2.ebuild
  files/hylafax-4.1.2-gentoo-diffs.tar.bz2 files/digest-hylafax-4.1.2 :

  Updated to newest stable release.  This is a pain to build because it requires
  a lower GNU/sed version than we have in portage.  So, GNU/sed-3.02 is fetched
  and built statically, so that it can be used to configure hylafax.  The
  other patches are taken from Mandrake's srpm for 4.1.1, but seems to work well
  with this.

*hylafax-cvs-000614-r1 (1 Feb 2002)

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog : 

  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
