# Dear user, welcome to the Gateway6 Client configuration file. 
# In order to use the client, you have to modify the 'userid', 
# 'passwd' and 'server' parameters below according to one of these 3 situations:
# 
# 1. If you created an account on Freenet6, enter your userid and password below. 
#    Also change the server name to "broker.freenet6.net". 
# 2. If you would like to use Freenet6 without creating an account, 
#    do not modify anything and close this file. 
# 3. If this software was provided by your ISP, put the userid, password and 
#    server name provided by your ISP below. 
#

########################## BASIC CONFIGURATION ################################

#   Specify your user name and password as provided by your ISP or Freenet6. 
#   Use anonymous if you don't have a username and leave the password field empty. 
#
userid=anonymous
passwd=

#
# Server:
#   Tunnel broker name or IP address (provided by your ISP or Freenet6).

########################## ROUTER CONFIGURATION ###############################
#
# Use these parameters for the client to act as a router and give IPv6 
# to several PCs.

#
# Proxy client: 
#  Indicates this client requests a tunnel for another endpoint, 
#  a Cisco router for example. 
#
# Note: NAT traversal is not possible in proxy mode. 
#
proxy_client=no


# Broker Redirection
#  The 'broker_list' directive specifies the name of the file
#  where a broker list received during broker redirection will
#  be saved. 
#
#  Default value: tsp-broker-list.txt
#  
#broker_list=
#
#  The 'last_server' directive specifies the name of the file
#  where the address of the last broker to which a connection
#  was successfully established will be saved.
#
#  Default value: tsp-last-server.txt
#
#last_server=
#
#  The value of the 'always_use_same_server' directive determines
#  if the client should always try to connect to the broker
#  specified with the 'last_server' directive (if any). 
#

#
# Log destinations:
#  The format is 'log=destination;level', where
#  possible values of 'destination' are:
#
#  console (logging to the console)
#  stderr (logging to standard error)
#  file (logging to a file)
#  syslog (logging to syslog [Unix only])
#
#  and 'level' is a digit between 0 and 3. A 'level'
#  value of 0 disables logging to the destination,
#  while values 1 to 3 request increasing levels of log
#  verbosity.
#
#  Multiple 'log' directives may be specified.
#
#  Examples
#    log=file;3 (Maximal logging to a file)
#    log=stderr;0 (Logging to stdandard error disabled)
#    log=console (Minimal logging to the console) 
#
#  If 'level' is not specified, a value of 1 is assumed.
#  In this case, the semicolon should be left out.
#
#  If no 'log' directive is specified at all, the
#  following will apply:
#
#  On Windows platforms:
#
#    log=console;0
#    log=stderr;0
#    log=file;1
#
#  On Unix platforms:
#
#    log=console;0
#    log=stderr;1
#    log=file;0
#    log=syslog;0
#
#log=

#
# Log file name:
#  When logging to file is requested using the 'log'
#  directive, the name and path of the file to use
#  may be specified using the 'log_filename' directive. 
#
#  Default value: gw6c.log
#
#log_filename=

#
# Log file rotation:
#  When logging to file is requested using the 'log'
#  directive, log file rotation may be enabled using
#  the 'log_rotation' directive.
#
#  When enabled, the contents of the log file will be
#  moved to a backup file just before it reaches the
#  maximal log file size specified via the 'log_rotation_size'
#  directive.
#
#  The name of the backup file is the name of the original
#  log file with '.<timestamp>' inserted before the file
#  extension. If the file does not have an extension,
#  '.<timestamp>' is appended to the name of the original
#  log file. The timestamp specifies when the rotation
#  occured.
#
#  After the contents of the log file have been moved
#  to the backup file, the original file is cleared, and
#  logging resumes at the beginning of the file. 
#
#  Default value: yes
#
#log_rotation=no

#
# Log file rotation size:
#  The 'log_rotation_size' directive specifies the
#  maximal size a log file may reach before rotation
#  occurs if it is enabled via the 'log_rotation' directive.
#
#  The value is expressed in kilobytes.
#
#  Minimal value: 16
#  Maximal value: 10240
#  Default value: 32
#
#log_rotation_size=

#
# Syslog logging facility [Unix only]:
#
#  When logging to syslog is requested using the 'log'
#  directive, the facility to use may be specified using
#  the 'syslog_facility' directive.
#
#  Valid values: USER, LOCAL[0-7]
#
#  Default value: USER
#
#syslog_facility=
