I was looking for a small and secure SSH server to fit on a laptop with 4 megs ram and no hard 
disk, and couldn't find one which was satisfactory. I decided to write my own, and Dropbear is 
the result. It implements most required features of the SSH 2 protocol, and other features such 
as X11, TCP and Authentication Agent forwarding. Dropbear is Open Source software, distributed 
under a MIT-style license.
