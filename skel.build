#Remeber to add the proper Author line, above.  Don't worry about the fourth line;
#it'll get automatically fixed when the ebuild is checked in

#Point to any required sources; these will be automatically downloaded by Portage
SRC_URI="ftp://foo.bar.com/${P}.tar.gz"

	#the install part of the Makefiles.  Also note that this will often

	#which is actually quite rare.
