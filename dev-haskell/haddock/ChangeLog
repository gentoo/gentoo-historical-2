*haddock-0.4 (21 May 2003)

  21 May 2003; Andres Loeh <kosmikus@gentoo.org> haddock-0.4.ebuild:
  Initial import. An ebuild has been submitted a long time ago
  already by Thomas L. Bevan <tom@regex.com.au>. Thanks for that.
  Haddock is a documentation tool for Haskell that is used by GHC
  itself to document most of its libraries.
