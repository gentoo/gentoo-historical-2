*parsec-2.0 (21 Dec 2007)

  21 Dec 2007; Duncan Coutts <dcoutts@gentoo.org> +parsec-2.0.ebuild,
  parsec-2.1.0.0.ebuild:
  Add older version that came bundles with ghc-6.6.1. Also add ~ppc because it
  worked before when it was part of the ghc ebuild and this is just a package
  split so it seems ok to carry keywords over.

*parsec-2.1.0.0 (20 Dec 2007)

  20 Dec 2007; Duncan Coutts <dcoutts@gentoo.org> +metadata.xml,
  +parsec-2.1.0.0.ebuild:
  Initial version. Was previously a core library, now independent of ghc.
