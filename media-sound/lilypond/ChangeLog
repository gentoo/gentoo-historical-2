  18 Jan 2003; Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org> lilypond-1.6.6.ebuild :
  Fix bug 13396 by requiring tetex-1.0.7-r12 which should fix the missing
  mf.base compilation problem.

*lilypond-1.6.6 (03 Dec 2002)

  03 Dec 2002; Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org> lilypond-1.6.6.ebuild :

  Update to version 1.6.6 which compiles with at least gcc-2.95.3 and
  gcc-3.2.1.  I put clauses in the ebuild to help compile for gcc-3.[01] but
  haven't been able to test them.  It shouldn't matter (much) since Gentoo 1.2
  is using gcc-2.95.3 and Gentoo 1.4 is using gcc-3.2.  This fixes BUG #4682.
  Thanks to Mike Ossmann <mike@ossmann.com> for his work on this version.

*lilypond-1.5.15 (1 Feb 2002)

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
  
  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
