*xmms-1.2.7-r{3,4} (28 Mar 2002)

  28 Mar 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> xmms-1.2.7-r{3,4}.ebuild :
  ogg and vorbis USE flags have been combined to form the oggvorbis flag.
  Kinda like Voltron.

*xmms-1.2.7-r4 (28 Mar 2002)

  28 Mar 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> xmms-1.2.7-r4.ebuild :
  Ha ha, wishful thinking on my part.  This revision gets rid of the "built-in"
  avi hack.  We still make use of the avi USE flag, because there are certain
  libraries we need to link against for the new avi plugin, called avi4xmms.

*xmms-1.2.7-r3 (27 Mar 2002)

  27 Mar 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> xmms-1.2.7-r3.ebuild :
  Well, I do hope that this is the last update on this in a while.  Finally,
  though, thanks to Matthew Kennedy, we can `man xmms` and actually see a
  man page.  This also makes us slightly more LFH compliant.

*xmms-1.2.7-r2 (21 Mar 2002)

  21 Mar 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> xmms-1.2.7-r2.ebuild :
  Now, avi is in the USE flags, which means the bloaty avi hack is an option
  that I think only few will take to anyway.

*xmms-1.2.7-r1 (19 Mar 2002)

  19 Mar 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> : added a patch to make
  xmms use avifile-0.6, which removes the necessity of having a separate
  avi-xmms module until that module can support avifile-0.6

*xmms-1.2.7 (05 Mar 2002)

  05 Mar 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> : new much-requested
  version bump.  Just copied ebuild over.

*xmms-1.2.6-r2 (28 Feb 2002)

  22 Feb 2002; Bruce A. Locke <blocke@shivan.org> xmms-1.2.6-r2.ebuild :
  spider.gentoo@darkmere.wanfear.com (Spider) contributed additional
  USE keyword checks
