  06 Dec 2002; Rodney Rees <manson@gentoo.org> : changed sparc ~sparc keywords
 
*xmms-1.2.7-r15 (14 Nov 2002)

  14 Nov 2002; Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org> :
  Made src_install delete ${D}/usr/lib/xmms/Input/libidcin.so.
  It causes ppc users to crash and the xmms developers have removed
  it from the distribution anyways.

*xmms-1.2.7-r14 (17 Oct 2002)

  17 Oct 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> :
  Add back the patch to link xmms against libstdc++, as some plugins
  need it.

*xmms-1.2.7-r13 (23 Aug 2002)

  12 Oct 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> xmms-1.2.7-r13.ebuild :
  Added directfb to IUSE.  XMMS doesn't need it, but will link to it if
  present, so it needs to be recompiled if DirectFB is updated.

  16 Sep 2002; Maarten Thibaut <murphy@gentoo.org> xmms-1.2.7-r13.ebuild :
  Added sparc/sparc64 keywords. Revamped ChangeLog layout.

  23 Aug 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> xmms-1.2.7-r13.ebuild
  files/digest-xmms-1.2.7-r13 : Removed all avi stuff from xmms ebuild,
  since the xmms folks have updated the avi-xmms plugin to be statically
  compiled against avifile.

  30 Aug 2002; Bart Verwilst <verwilst@gentoo.org>: Filtered out -fforce-addr
  out of xmms, segfaults when trying to play a song otherwise

*xmms-1.2.7-r12 (18 Jul 2002)

  16 Sep 2002; Maarten Thibaut <murphy@gentoo.org> xmms-1.2.7-r12.ebuild : Added
  sparc/sparc64 keywords.

  31 Jul 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> xmms-1.2.7-r12.ebuild :
  Minor form fixes.

  20 Jul 2002; Spider <spider@gentoo.org> xmms-1.2.7-r12.ebuild : Minor dep
  change to kill bug #4317.

  19 Jul 2002; Daniel Ahlberg <aliz@gentoo.org> xmms-1.2.7-r12.ebuild : Closes
  #5208.

  18 Jul 2002; Daniel Ahlberg <aliz@gentoo.org> xmms-1.2.7-r12.ebuild : Cleaned
  up ebuild. Made mikmod optional through USE setting.

*xmms-1.2.7-r11 (30 Jun 2002)

  30 Jun 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> : This revision tries to fix
  all the automake/autoconf warning, etc.
  I have tested it with gcc-2.95.3 and gcc-3.1, so hopefully it will
  be the last revision for some time.

*xmms-1.2.7-r10 (28 Jun 2002)

  28 Jun 2002; Spider <spider@gentoo.org> xmms-1.2.7-r9.ebuild : Removed
  gnome-core dep in favour of gnome-panel-1.4.1 
 
*xmms-1.2.7-r9 (06 June 2002)

  06 June 2002; Brandon Low <lostlogic@gentoo.org> xmms-1.2.7-r9.ebuild,
  files/xmms-1.2.7-gentoo.patch: New revision with a generated patch to fix a
  bunch of error output which was happening at compile time, also hopefully
  closes 3431, but waiting on confirmation of that.

  06 June 2002; Bruce A. Locke <blocke@shivan.org> xmms-1.2.7-r9.ebuild,
  files/xmms-1.2.7-gentoo.patch: Removed due to automake/autoconf issues.

*xmms-1.2.7-r8 (02 June 2002)

  02 June 2002; Gabriele Giorgetti <stroke@gentoo.org> xmms-1.2.7-r8.ebuild:
  digest-xmms-1.2.7-r8 added. fixes bug #3325

  02 June 2002; Olivier Reisch <doctomoe@gentoo.org> xmms-1.2.7-r8.ebuild:
  xmms-1.2.7 r6 and r7 are broken on PPC. The src_unpack function fails on the
  3dnow/mmx patch inclusion check. Included an arch check to exclude the code
  from being executed on PPC.

*xmms-1.2.7-r7 (30 May 2002)

  30 May 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> xmms-1.2.7-r7.ebuild
  files/digest-xmms-1.2.7-r7 : Added a patch to optimise for 3dnow and mmx. 
  Thanks to aliz@telia.com (Daniel Ahlberg) in bug #2630.  Fixed use avi && patch
  syntax per Daniel Sabo in bug #3086

*xmms-1.2.7-r6 (19 May 2002)

  26 May 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> xmms-1.2.7-r6.ebuild :
  Change it to depend on latest avifile, and drop the suffix patch
  for avifile-config.

*xmms-1.2.7-r5 (19 May 2002)

  19 May 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> xmms-1.2.7-r5.ebuild :
  Fix things to actually compile the plugin when "avi" is in USE, and made
  it compadible with the latest avifile (0.7.4) which use an suffix ( this
  having /usr/bin/avifile-config0.7 and not /usr/bin/avifile-config).
  I am not too sure with this suffix thing .. we need to decide if we are
  going to keep it, or just fix the broken stuff .. personally I think we
  should rather fix broken build, and drop the suffix from avifile.

*xmms-1.2.7-r4 (11 Apr 2002)

  11 Apr 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> xmms-1.2.7-r4.ebuild :
  Svend Sorensen (SCube on #gentoo) pointed out that libxml is only an optional
  dependency to retrieve cd track info from an alternate source, so that has
  been made USE dependent.

*xmms-1.2.7-r{3,4} (28 Mar 2002)

  28 Mar 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> xmms-1.2.7-r{3,4}.ebuild :
  ogg and vorbis USE flags have been combined to form the oggvorbis flag.
  Kinda like Voltron.

*xmms-1.2.7-r4 (28 Mar 2002)

  28 Mar 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> xmms-1.2.7-r4.ebuild :
  Ha ha, wishful thinking on my part.  This revision gets rid of the "built-in"
  avi hack.  We still make use of the avi USE flag, because there are certain
  libraries we need to link against for the new avi plugin, called avi4xmms.

*xmms-1.2.7-r3 (27 Mar 2002)

  27 Mar 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> xmms-1.2.7-r3.ebuild :
  Well, I do hope that this is the last update on this in a while.  Finally,
  though, thanks to Matthew Kennedy, we can `man xmms` and actually see a
  man page.  This also makes us slightly more LFH compliant.

*xmms-1.2.7-r2 (21 Mar 2002)

  21 Mar 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> xmms-1.2.7-r2.ebuild :
  Now, avi is in the USE flags, which means the bloaty avi hack is an option
  that I think only few will take to anyway.

*xmms-1.2.7-r1 (19 Mar 2002)

  19 Mar 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> : added a patch to make
  xmms use avifile-0.6, which removes the necessity of having a separate
  avi-xmms module until that module can support avifile-0.6

*xmms-1.2.7 (05 Mar 2002)

  05 Mar 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> : new much-requested
  version bump.  Just copied ebuild over.

*xmms-1.2.6-r2 (28 Feb 2002)

  22 Feb 2002; Bruce A. Locke <blocke@shivan.org> xmms-1.2.6-r2.ebuild :
  spider.gentoo@darkmere.wanfear.com (Spider) contributed additional
  USE keyword checks
