*rip-1.01 (7 Apr 2002)

  7 Apr 2002; G. Shapovalov <george@gentoo.org> Changelog:

  Initial release of this ebuild. Contains rip-1.01 and rip-1.01-r1
  rip-1.01.ebuild:
  	installs two perl modules in addition to the script itself
	(because of the way script is packaged: modules were included and 
	author claims they are hard to find)
	DEPRECATED!  use rip-1.01-r1 instead!
  rip-1.01-r1.ebuild:
  	installs script only, necessary modules are installed separately and listed as RDEPEND


  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
  
  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
