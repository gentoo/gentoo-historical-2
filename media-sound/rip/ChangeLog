  28 Aug 2002; Calum Selkirk <cselkirk@gentoo.org> rip-1.01-r1 :

  Added ppc to KEYWORDS.

  Initial release of this ebuild. Contains rip-1.01 and rip-1.01-r1
  rip-1.01.ebuild:
  	installs two perl modules in addition to the script itself
	(because of the way script is packaged: modules were included and 
	author claims they are hard to find)
	DEPRECATED!  use rip-1.01-r1 instead!
  rip-1.01-r1.ebuild:
  	installs script only, necessary modules are installed separately and listed as RDEPEND
