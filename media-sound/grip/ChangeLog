*grip-2.98.5 (1 Feb 2002)
  
  1 Feb 2002; T.Neidt <tod@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :

  New version released to fix nasty bug in 2.98.3 that caused grip to crash
  after ripping the last track of a cd.  No changes to the ebuild, just a 
  copy of grip-2.98.3-r1.ebuild to grip-2.98.5.ebuild. =media-sound/grip-2.98.3
  has been package masked.
