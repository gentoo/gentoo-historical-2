  changed jack depend to virtual/jack

*ecasound-2.2.0_rc1 ( 8 Jan 2003)

  8 Jan 2003; Tobias Eichert <viz@gentoo.org> ecasound-2.2.0_rc1.ebuild
  files/digest-ecasound-2.2.0_rc1

  Version bump.
  Added "media-sound/jack-audio-connection-kit" as a dependency.
  Anyways, jack support is optional but we don't have a jack USE
  flag (see bug #12527). If you really like to compile ecasound
  with jack disabled, just remove this dependency.
  Thanks to Paul Thompson <thompson@pobox.com> for contribution
  and minor ebuild cleanups. Closes bug #12381.

  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is updated in 
  any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the comments should
  well explained and written in clean English. The details about writing correct
  changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you can find in the root
  directory of the portage repository.  Thanks to Jay Felice <jfelice@cronosys.com>
  for the ebuild.
