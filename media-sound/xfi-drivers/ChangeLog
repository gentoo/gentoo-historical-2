*xfi-drivers-1.00 (09 Nov 2008)

  09 Nov 2008; Peter Alfredsen <loki_val@gentoo.org> +metadata.xml,
  +xfi-drivers-1.00.ebuild:
  Initial commit, ebuild by me. I don't have hardware for this, so anyone
  who does is free to take over maintaining this. Will be punted when the
  code has been integrated into upstream kernel. May eat cats, dogs and
  other pets, use at your own peril.
