  08 Feb 2003; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> waif-0.59.3.ebuild :

  Added id3ed as a dependency to make waifsh show the id3 instead of
  filename.  Thanks to tseng in oftc.net #gentoo.

  Added license -- quote from an e-mail that Matthew Levine (the author of
  waif and wfxmms) sent me.

  ChangeLog files/digest-waif-0.59.3 :

  Why Another Infernal Frontend?!  Well, this is more of an un-frontend
  written in expect.  Essentially, it acts as a front end to play different
  kinds of audio files (from wav to mp3 to ogg to realplayer to midi) -- you
  choose the player (including xmms and freeamp) for each time, execute
  waif, which backgrounds itself and plays at your command.   It is heavily
  documented, so take a peek through the docs, and emerge takcd to control
  your cdplayer with waif as well.  Note that this is a console app.
