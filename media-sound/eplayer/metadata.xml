eVorbisPlayer is an OggVorbis audio player which requires the Xiph Ogg 
Suite of libraries

Q: Why another damned audio player?
A: -> The purpose of eVorbisPlayer has always been to be used as a 
vehicle by which to better
learn the EFL componants.  And audio player was choosen because it's 
interesting, the OggVorbis
API is very simple and can easily drawn on Ecore's strengths (ie: idlers 
and timers) and provides
a number of interesting interface possibilities.  The intension has 
never been, and probly
never will be, to build a robust, functional and flexable audio player.
