*alsa-driver-0.9.0_beta10 (3 Feb 2002)

  8 Feb 2002; Donny Davies <woodchip@gentoo.org> ChangeLog,
  alsa-driver-0.5.11.ebuild, alsa-driver-0.5.12a.ebuild,
  alsa-driver-0.9.0_beta10.ebuild:

  Moved the code looking for the kernel sources into pkg_setup().
  Closes bug #273.  No revisions bumped, mostly a cosmetic change.

  3 Feb 2002; T.Neidt <tod@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :

  Upgraded version to latest beta.
  The issue below seems to be fixable by creating a link in the alsa-lib
  ebuild from libasound.so.2 to libasound.so.1, but I'm leaving the warning
  until further testing is done.
  ##WARNING## Upgrading to this version will require massive recompiling
  of pretty much everything linked against sound.  libasound.so.1 is
  no longer provided in the package, it is now libasound.so.2.  Sound
  apps will be broken until recompiled against the new lib.  For example,
  if you use the Gnome Desktop, you will have to recompile almost everything
  just to start it up.  Good news is you don't have to upgrade now if you
  don't want to.  Bad news is that you will eventually.

*alsa-driver-0.5.12a (1 Feb 2002)

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
  
  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
