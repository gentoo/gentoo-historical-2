*nforce-audio-1.0.0261 (11 Jun 2003)

  11 Jun 2003; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org>: updated build that now
  disables SPDIF digital audio output by default, but tells the user how to
  enable it. It needs to be disabled because with SPDIF enabled by default, the
  sound chip will only play back at 48KHz, causing several audio players to
  play back CD audio at the wrong speed.

*nforce-audio-1.0.0256 (07 May 2003)

  07 May 2003; Dean Bailey <alron@gentoo.org> :initial ebuild.
