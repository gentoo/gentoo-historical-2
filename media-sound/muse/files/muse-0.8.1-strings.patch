-MuSE <-------------------------------> Multiple Streaming Engine 
-MuSE is an application for the mixing, encoding, and streaming of sound:
-is an engine that can simultaniously mix up to 6 separate MP3 or OggVorbis
-audio files from the hard drive or the network, where each channel of 
-audio can be dynamicly adjusted for speed and volume plus a soundcard 
-line-in channel. The resulting stream can be played locally on the sound 
-card and/or encoded as an mp3 network stream to an icecast or shoutcast 
-server (ready to be mixed and played again by other muses... ;)
-
-MuSE has been created and is mantained by 
-Denis Rojo aka jaromil <jaromil@dyne.org>
-The GTK+ graphical user interface is developed by 
-nightolo <night@autistici.org>
-The ncurses user interface is developed by
-Luca Profico aka rubik <rubik@olografix.org>
-
-MuSE as it is now would have never existed without the contributions of:
-= Markus Seidl ( funda.ment.org ) for the idea of mixing and streaming 
-  multiple files
-= August Black ( aug.ment.org ) for the original graphical user interface
-= SERVUS.AT for trusting this project since the beginning and supporting it
-= PUBLIC VOICE Lab ( pvl.at ) for recently giving MuSE support and new 
-  horizons of use
-= Asbesto Molesto ( freaknet.org ) for the extensive testing and 
-  documentation
-= Alex, Rasty and Martinez ( ! ) for the good karma
-
-also BIG THANKS to:
-lobo, voyager, void, blicero, saiborg, the freaknet medialab, the ASCII 
-squat, henk, the imc-audio collective, jeff, the LOA hacklab, the TPO, 
-bundes & didi, indymedia italy, neural.it, the autistici.org collective, 
-mag-one, radio onda rossa and all the others i'm forgetting here!
-	
-MuSE redistributes, linking statically, the following libraries:
-= libmpeg by Woo-jae Jung (now mantained by Mikael Hedin)
-= libshout by Jack Moffit, Chad Armstrong and Scott Manley
-= libcdk by Mike Glover
-
-(refer to documentation included into subdirectories for more informations)
-
-MuSE can link dinamically to the following libraries:
-= libogg, libvorbis, libvorbisfile - www.xiph.org
-= glib, libgdk, libgtk - www.gtk.org
-= liblame - www.mp3dev.org/mp3
-= libX11, libXext - www.xfree86.org
-= other common GNU libraries
-
-MuSE sourcecode also got inspirations from:
-= stream mixer code by Scott Manley
-= buffered FIFO pipe code by Charles Samuels.
