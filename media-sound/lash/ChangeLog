  31 Mar 2006; Frank van de Pol <fvdpol@gentoo.org> ChangeLog:
  LASH is a session management system for JACK and ALSA audio applications on
  GNU/Linux. Its aim is to allow you to have many different audio programs
  running at once, to save their setup, close them down and then easily reload
  the setup at some other time. LASH doesn't deal with any kind of audio data
  itself; it just runs programs, deals with saving/loading (arbitrary) data
  and connects different kinds of virtual audio ports together (currently JACK
  and ALSA sequencer ports). It can also be used to move entire sessions
  between computers, or post sessions on the Internet for download.
