Known Bugs/Problems

Sawfish:  Status plugins and Sawfish 1.0.1 will not stick the 
applet in the docklet, this is a Sawfish issue unmerge Sawfish
1.0.1 and merge Sawfish 1.0.0 works fine.

Enlightenment: Status plugins and enlightenment do not play well
together, this is not anyones fault, but is due to the rather
hacky way in which status windows are implemented. Unfortunately
I don't use E and haven't got the time to implement anything myself.
