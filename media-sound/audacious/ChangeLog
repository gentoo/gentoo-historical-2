*audacious-0.1 (30 Oct 2005)

  30 Oct 2005; <chainsaw@gentoo.org> +metadata.xml, +audacious-0.1.ebuild:
  Initial commit, ebuild by me. Mikmod playback has been disabled, because
  it fails compilation. AAC playback builds but does not appear to work.
  If you submit a bug about that, include a patch to enable compilation and
  include a test track. A bug report that misses either of these will be
  closed.
