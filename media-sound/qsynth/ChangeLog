*qsynth-0.2.1 (20 Jun 2004)

  20 Jun 2004; Frank van de Pol <fvdpol@gentoo.org> +qsynth-0.2.1.ebuild:
  Updated to new upstream version of qsynth.
  Changed since previous gentoo package according to qsynth changelog:
  
  0.2.1   2004-04-30  Important internal fixes.
  
  - Channels window reset when switching engines isn't destructive
    anymore; also reverb and chorus activation were not being correctly
    updated; these were quite annoying bugs, now fixed.
  
  - Corrected MIDI/Audio driver settings that were being obliterated from
    the setup dialog option lists; this was causing the impossibility to
    choose an appropriate driver on certain systems where "alsa_seq" or
    "jack" may not be available by default (e.g. MacOSX, thanks to Ebrahim
    Mayat).
    
  - The dash (-) is now a legal character for preset names.
  
  - Translation support for the default preset name "(default)".
  
  - Delete preset confirmation warning message.
  
  - Messages window pops up whenever a critical error message is issued.
  
  
  0.2.0   2004-03-21  Multi-instance comes to town.
  
  - Multiple fluidsynth engines can now be maintained, with different
    settings, MIDI and Audio drivers, and more interestingly distinct
    soundfont stacks. The main user interface has been minimally
    improved to accomodate this new paradigm, but whole application
    internals have been massively rewritten.
    
  
  0.1.3   2004-02-29  More work in progress.
  
  - Message window line limit is now a configurable option on setup.
  
  - ALSA sequencer client name may now be internally set; not of great use
    for now, but it opens the ground for future workings.
  
  - JACK multiple output port mode may now be configured on setup.
  
  - Makefile.cvs makes its late entrance on the build toolset.
  
  
  0.1.2   2004-02-16  Work in progress.
  
  - Messages and Channels pop-up windows are not hinted as dialogs anymore
    and thus are not centered relative to parent main window which has become
    a strict Qt dialog widget behaviour (as of Qt 3.3+).
  
  - Soundfont setup dialog changed to open and load multiple files at once.
  
  - New setup option on wether all child windows are kept on top of the main
    window, or otherwise floating with probable taskbar entries of their own.
  
  - Setup changes that are only effective next time the program is run gets
    an informational message box shown to the user.
  
  
  0.1.1   2004-01-22  Yet more minor bugfixes.
  
  - Messages color retouching.
  
  - Popup menus memory leak fixed.

  20 Jun 2004; Frank van de Pol <fvdpol@gentoo.org> metadata.xml,
  qsynth-0.1.0.ebuild:
  Fixed sandbox violations, closing bug #45289.
  
  (note: Package was marked stable x86; left it that way since this is only a
  correction in the ebuild. Flagging it ~x86 might break people's systems who
  managed to install it.)

*qsynth-0.1.0 (15 Jan 2004)

  15 Jan 2004; Wout Mertens <wmertens@gentoo.org> qsynt-0.1.0.ebuild:
  Initial revision, marked stable because of simple ebuild and not a
  dependency for other things.
