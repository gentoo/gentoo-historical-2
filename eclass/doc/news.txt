v4
Added multi-qt and multi-kdelibs functionality. See detailed explanation in eclass howto.
There is now a new depend.eclass inherited by kde.eclass. It provides two pairs of
functions, need-{kdelibs,qt} and set-{kdedir,qtdir}.
An inheriting ebuild calls "need-kdelibs $ver" from its main section and gets the correct
things added to DEPEND and RDEPEND. Same for qt. Usually ebuilds don't call need-qt
directly, because the kdelibs depend already provides them with the necessary qt
version, but the function does exist and is usable.
The set-* functions are called at the beginning of kde_src_compile/configure section.
They export the correct QTDIR and KDEDIR (the latter points to the location of kdelibs)
based on the vars kde_version and qt_version which are set in need-*. (So don't touch
these vars; I've added a list of Internal Vars to the eclass howto). If no multi-*-scheme
compatible directories are found, set-* leaves KDEDIR/QTDIR untouched, this enables
older systems to work with the new eclass and ebuilds.
There have been many other misc small changes in the eclasses, because this was a
big commit after weeks of testing. For example the newdepend() function was added to
base.eclass; I'll eventually modify ebuilds to use it.
When the new dep functionality is added to portage, I'll change the need-* functions
accordingly, but the ebuilds won't need to be changed.

Added koffice-i18n.eclass, very similar to kde-i18n.eclass.

15/10
Added some multi-QTDIR failsafes (shouldn't be needed, but do no harm):
myconf+=--with-qt-dir=${QTDIR}
LIBRARY_PATH=${LIBRARY_PATH}:${QTDIR}/lib make

kde-objprelink-patch fixes

5/10
v3.3
Removal of kde-objprelink. You now inherit from it no longer :-)
It has been merged into kde. You will get the dependency and the configure parameter
automatically, and can call kde-objprelink-patch() (which is now in kde.eclass) if needed.

3/10
v3.2
Addition of kde-objprelink, further minor changes and fixes.
You now inherit from kde-objprelink. If you need the admin patch, run kde-objprelink-patch()
at the end of src_unpack. kde-dist inherits from kde-objprelink, other eclasses do not.

2/10
Unmasking of eclasses. Other developers test, but do not use in their work. Evaluation period.

1/10
v3.1
Addition of debug.eclass.

1/10
v3
Another major change.
This involves primarily the kde eclasses.

We now have kde.eclass, which is *not* the same as kde.eclass from v2, but is
rather a kde-virtual eclass. It includes all the basic definitions and standard
functions. It is med-level; people do not usually inherit from it.

Then, we have high-level eclasses:
kde-base.eclass inherits c,kde and adds pbjprelink,qt deps. It's used by misc apps.
kde.org.eclass adds the SRC_URI/SRC_PATH block for ftp.kde.org and friends.
kde-dist.eclass inherits kde-base,kde.org and adds HOMEPAGE,DESCRIPTION etc. and
	Kkdelibs-${PV} deps. It is used by kdebase/* packages.
kde-i18n.eclass inerits kde,kde.org and adds the neccessary things for kde-i18n packages.
	It will probably be used for the upcoming koffice-i18n packages as well.

Notice, now you now longer call kde-base_ and kde-i18n_ functions, but only kde_ functions.

I have had to swap eclasses' names around to make them more intuitive. Here is a table
of the changes:
kde-virtual	=>	kde
kde			=>	kde-base
kde-base	=>	kde-dist + kde.org
kde-i18n	==	kde-i18n

(kde-virtual was a mid-stage eclass from version 2.5 which was never commited on cvs).

1/10
v2.5
A temp version which wasn't commited. Testbed for radical ideas.

30/9
v2
Documented in original howto

29/9
v1
Original version
Had an infinite recursion in base.eclass. Was deleted from cvs later that day.
