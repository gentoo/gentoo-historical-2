v3.4
Multiple qt version support.
None of the primary eclasses defines any qt depends.
Every ebuild inherits qt?.eclass (?=2,3...) which sets QTDIR and adds qt to
DEPEND and RDEPEND.
If you do not inherit this explicitly, you will get a QTDIR pointing to the qt
installed last. On a qt2/3 system this breaks everything, but on current qt2-only
systems it has no effect and gives us some time to fix all ebuilds. (Actually,
I'll change them all myself; it's a part of this v3.4 commit.)
In the next revision we will have qtXYZ.eclass which will work for >=qt-X.Y.Z.
qt2.eclass currently defines >=qt-2.3.1-r2 which is the first version with the
/etc/env.d multi-qt support.
Right now, no one should install qt3. We're waiting for portage support for * deps.
Without qt3 installed, the qt2 changes (which is all I'm committing right now)
won't affect anything.
The one exception are those who have a qt installed in /usr. These should merge
>=qt-2.3.1-r2 and unmerge the old version.
qt libs are binary-incompatible between minor versions (the Y in x.Y.z). To allow
peole with <qt-2.3 to avoid recompiling all their kde apps for the new qt-2.3.1, I will
reintroduce ebuilds for qt 2.1.x and 2.2.x into cvs, with the multi-qt support
(does anyone still use qt2.0?).

kde-objprelink-patch fixes

5/10
v3.3
Removal of kde-objprelink. You now inherit from it no longer :-)
It has been merged into kde. You will get the dependency and the configure parameter
automatically, and can call kde-objprelink-patch() (which is now in kde.eclass) if needed.

3/10
v3.2
Addition of kde-objprelink, further minor changes and fixes.
You now inherit from kde-objprelink. If you need the admin patch, run kde-objprelink-patch()
at the end of src_unpack. kde-dist inherits from kde-objprelink, other eclasses do not.

2/10
Unmasking of eclasses. Other developers test, but do not use in their work. Evaluation period.

1/10
v3.1
Addition of debug.eclass.

1/10
v3
Another major change.
This involves primarily the kde eclasses.

We now have kde.eclass, which is *not* the same as kde.eclass from v2, but is
rather a kde-virtual eclass. It includes all the basic definitions and standard
functions. It is med-level; people do not usually inherit from it.

Then, we have high-level eclasses:
kde-base.eclass inherits c,kde and adds pbjprelink,qt deps. It's used by misc apps.
kde.org.eclass adds the SRC_URI/SRC_PATH block for ftp.kde.org and friends.
kde-dist.eclass inherits kde-base,kde.org and adds HOMEPAGE,DESCRIPTION etc. and
	Kkdelibs-${PV} deps. It is used by kdebase/* packages.
kde-i18n.eclass inerits kde,kde.org and adds the neccessary things for kde-i18n packages.
	It will probably be used for the upcoming koffice-i18n packages as well.

Notice, now you now longer call kde-base_ and kde-i18n_ functions, but only kde_ functions.

I have had to swap eclasses' names around to make them more intuitive. Here is a table
of the changes:
kde-virtual	=>	kde
kde			=>	kde-base
kde-base	=>	kde-dist + kde.org
kde-i18n	==	kde-i18n

(kde-virtual was a mid-stage eclass from version 2.5 which was never commited on cvs).

1/10
v2.5
A temp version which wasn't commited. Testbed for radical ideas.

30/9
v2
Documented in original howto

29/9
v1
Original version
Had an infinite recursion in base.eclass. Was deleted from cvs later that day.
