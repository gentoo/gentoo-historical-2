# The xfree.eclass is designed to ease the checking functions that are
# performed in xfree and xfree-drm ebuilds.  In the new scheme, a variable
# called VIDEO_CARDS will be used to indicate which cards a user wishes to
# build support for.  Note, that this variable is only unlocked if the USE
# variable "expertxfree" is switched on, at least for xfree.
