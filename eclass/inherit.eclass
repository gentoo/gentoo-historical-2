# This eclass provides the inherit() function. In the future it will be placed in ebuild.sh, but for now drobbins 
# doesn't want to make a new portage just for my testing, so every eclass/ebuild will source this file manually and
# then inherit(). This way when the time comes for this to move into ebuild.sh, we can just delete the source lines.

# Since portage-1.8.9_pre32 eclasses were partially merged with ebuild.sh and this part went there.
# Since we're providing backward support for rc6 profile/portage-1.8.8 owners till a month after
# the 1.0 release, I do this which is like a c++ include file's #ifdef...#define...#endif

# $ECLASSDIR is defined in ebuild.sh in new portages. If it isn't there go into compatibility mode,
# else sourcing this file does nothing
