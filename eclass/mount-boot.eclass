# @ECLASS: mount-boot.eclass
# @MAINTAINER:
# base-system@gentoo.org
# @BLURB: functions for packages that install files into /boot
# @DESCRIPTION:
# This eclass is really only useful for bootloaders.
#
# If the live system has a separate /boot partition configured, then this
# function tries to ensure that it's mounted in rw mode, exiting with an
# error if it can't. It does nothing if /boot isn't a separate partition.
