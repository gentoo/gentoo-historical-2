# @BLURB: functions to provide pax markings
# @DESCRIPTION:
# This eclass provides support for manipulating PaX markings on ELF binaries,
# wrapping the use of the paxctl and scanelf utilities.  It decides which to
# use depending on what is installed on the build host, preferring paxctl to
# scanelf.  If paxctl is not installed, we fall back to scanelf since it is
# always present.  However, currently scanelf doesn't do all that paxctl can.
#
# To control what markings are made, set PAX_MARKINGS in /etc/make.conf to
# contain either "PT" or "none".  If PAX_MARKINGS is set to "PT", and the
# necessary utility is installed, the PT_PAX_FLAGS markings will be made.  If
# PAX_MARKINGS is set to "none", no markings will be made.

inherit eutils

# Default to PT markings.
PAX_MARKINGS=${PAX_MARKINGS:="PT"}

# @FUNCTION: pax-mark
# @USAGE: <flags> {<ELF files>}
# @RETURN: Shell true if we succeed, shell false otherwise
# @DESCRIPTION:
# Marks <ELF files> with provided PaX <flags>
#
# Flags are passed directly to the utilities unchanged.  Possible flags at the
# time of writing, taken from /sbin/paxctl, are:
#
#	p: disable PAGEEXEC		P: enable PAGEEXEC
#	e: disable EMUTRMAP		E: enable EMUTRMAP
#	m: disable MPROTECT		M: enable MPROTECT
#	r: disable RANDMMAP		R: enable RANDMMAP
#	s: disable SEGMEXEC		S: enable SEGMEXEC
#
# Default flags are 'PeMRS', which are the most restrictive settings.  Refer
# to http://pax.grsecurity.net/ for details on what these flags are all about.
# Do not use the obsolete flag 'x'/'X' which has been deprecated.
#
# Please confirm any relaxation of restrictions with the Gentoo Hardened team.
# Either ask on the gentoo-hardened mailing list, or CC/assign hardened@g.o on
# the bug report.

# @FUNCTION: list-paxables
# @USAGE: {<files>}
# @RETURN: Subset of {<files>} which are ELF executables or shared objects
# @DESCRIPTION:
# Print to stdout all of the <files> that are suitable to have PaX flag
# markings, i.e., filter out the ELF executables or shared objects from a list
# of files.  This is useful for passing wild-card lists to pax-mark, although
# in general it is preferable for ebuilds to list precisely which ELFS are to
# be marked.  Often not all the ELF installed by a package need remarking.
# @EXAMPLE:
# pax-mark -m $(list-paxables ${S}/{,usr/}bin/*)

}

# @FUNCTION: host-is-pax
# @RETURN: Shell true if the build process is PaX enabled, shell false otherwise
# @DESCRIPTION:
# This is intended for use where the build process must be modified conditionally
# depending on whether the host is PaX enabled or not.  It is not intedened to
# determine whether the final binaries need PaX markings.  Note: if procfs is
# not mounted on /proc, this returns shell false (e.g. Gentoo/FBSD).
