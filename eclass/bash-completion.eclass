# @FUNCTION: dobashcompletion
# @USAGE: < file > [ new_file ]
# @DESCRIPTION:
# First arg, <file>, is required and is the location of the bash-completion
# script to install.  If the variable BASH_COMPLETION_NAME is set in the
# ebuild, dobashcompletion will install <file> as
# /usr/share/bash-completion/$BASH_COMPLETION_NAME. If it is not set,
# dobashcompletion will check if a second arg [new_file] was passed, installing as
# the specified name.  Failing both these checks, dobashcompletion will
# install the file as /usr/share/bash-completion/${PN}.
