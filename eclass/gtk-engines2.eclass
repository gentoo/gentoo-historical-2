# 
# This is a utility eclass for installing GTK+ Theme Engines. It detects
# whether gtk+-1 and/or gtk+-2 is installed and sets up variables to help with
# installing the engines into the right position.
#
# Variables it sets are :
#
#  HAS_GTK1 / HAS_GTK2   -- simply if GTK+1 or GTK+2 is installed
#  GTK1_ENGINES_DIR      -- directory where gtk+1 engines are installed
#  GTK2_ENGINES_DIR      -- directory where gtk+2 engines are installed
#
# *** NOTE *** If your engine has both GTK+1 and GTK+2 versions :
#
#  Set the following variables if they are in different directories:
# 
#  GTK1_S  -- GTK+1 Source Directory
#  GTK2_S  -- GTK+2 Source Directory
#
#  Also note you should not set DEPEND and let the eclass set the dependencies 
#
# Comments:
#
# Most theme engines include ./configure scripts that solve most of the
# path problems. Sometimes there are certain versions that have trouble
# with paths. If they do, then you can use the above variables
#
# We do not employ USE flags "gtk" and "gtk2" because they are unsuitable
# in this case. We install the whole package of themes available, both
# GTK+1 and GTK+2 if available. We assume that the user would want both
# since the space savings are negligible.
# 
# Note that this deals specifically with GTK ENGINES and not GTK THEMES. Some
# engines have themes that accompany them, and they are thus installed. You
# should not be using this eclass (it won't help anyway) if you are making
# a pure GTK+ theme ebuild.
