# This is for kde-base cvs ebuilds. Read comments about settings.
# It uses $S and sets $SRC_URI, so inherit it as late as possible (certainly after any other eclasses).
# See http://www.gentoo.org/~danarmak/kde-cvs.html !
# All of the real functionality is in cvs.eclass; this just adds some trivial kde-specific items

# Set yours in profile (e.g. make.conf), or export from the command line to override.
# Most have acceptable default values or are set by the ebuilds, but be sure to read the comments
# in cvs.eclass for detailed descriptions of them all.
# You should probably set at least ECVS_SERVER.

# inheriting kde_source.
