# This is for kde-base cvs ebuilds. Read comments about settings.
# It uses $S and sets $SRC_URI, so inherit it as late as possible (certainly after any other eclasses).
# See http://www.gentoo.org/~danarmak/kde-cvs.html !
# All of the real functionality is in cvs.eclass; this just adds some trivial kde-specific items


# --- begin user-configurable settings ---

# Set yours in profile (e.g. make.conf), or export from the command line to override.
# Most have acceptable default values or are set by the ebuilds, but be sure to read the comments
# in cvs.eclass for detailed descriptions of them all.
# You should probably set at least ECVS_SERVER.

# TODO: add options to store the modules as tarballs in $DISTDIR or elsewhere

# Under this directory the cvs modules are stored/accessed
# Storing in tarballs in $DISTDIR to be implemented soon

# Set to name of cvs server. Set to "" to disable fetching (offline mode).
# In offline mode, we presume that modules are already checked out at the specified
# location and that they shouldn't be updated.
# Format example: "anoncvs.kde.org:/home/kde" (without :pserver:anonymous@ part)
# Mirror list is available at http://developer.kde.org/source/anoncvs.html

# If a tag is specified as ECVS_BRANCH, it will be used for the kde-common module
# as well. If that is wrong (fex when checking out kopete branch kopete_0_6_2_release),
# use KCVS_BRANCH instead.

# you can set this variable (in your ebuild, of course) to disable fetching of <module>/doc/*
# under the KCVS_SUBDIR scheme. this is appropriate for kde-i18n stuff, but not for
# eg kdeextragear, kdenonbeta etc.
# KCVS_SUBDIR_NODOC=true

# Other variables: see cvs.eclass

# we do this here and not in the very beginning because we need to keep
# the configuration order intact: env. and profile settings override
# kde-source.eclass defaults, which in turn override cvs.eclass defaults
inherit cvs
#... and reset $ECLASS. Ugly I know, hopefully I can prettify it someday

# from the cvs ones). To download patches or something, set SRC_URI again after
# inheriting kde_source.
