# @BLURB: Emacs-related installation utilities
# @DESCRIPTION:
#
# Usually you want to use this eclass for (optional) GNU Emacs support
# of your package.  This is NOT for XEmacs!
#
# Many of the steps here are sometimes done by the build system of your
# package (especially compilation), so this is mainly for standalone
# elisp files you gathered from somewhere else.
#
# When relying on the emacs USE flag, you need to add
#
#   	emacs? ( virtual/emacs )
#
# to your DEPEND/RDEPEND line and use the functions provided here to
# bring the files to the correct locations.
#
# .SS
# src_compile() usage:
#
# An elisp file is compiled by the elisp-compile() function defined
# here and simply takes the source files as arguments.  The case of
# interdependent elisp files is also supported, since the current
# directory is added to the load-path which makes sure that all files
# are loadable.
#
#   	elisp-compile *.el || die
#
# Function elisp-make-autoload-file() can be used to generate a file
# with autoload definitions for the lisp functions.  It takes the output
# file name (default: "${PN}-autoloads.el") and a list of directories
# (default: working directory) as its arguments.  Use of this function
# requires that the elisp source files contain magic ";;;###autoload"
# comments.  See the Emacs Lisp Reference Manual (node "Autoload") for
# a detailed explanation.
#
# .SS
# src_install() usage:
#
# The resulting compiled files (.elc) should be put in a subdirectory of
# /usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/ which is named after the first argument
# of elisp-install().  The following parameters are the files to be put
# in that directory.  Usually the subdirectory should be ${PN}, you can
# choose something else, but remember to tell elisp-site-file-install()
# (see below) the change, as it defaults to ${PN}.
#
#   	elisp-install ${PN} *.el *.elc || die
#
# To let the Emacs support be activated by Emacs on startup, you need
# to provide a site file (shipped in ${FILESDIR}) which contains the
# startup code (have a look in the documentation of your software).
# Normally this would look like this:
#
#   	(add-to-list 'load-path "@SITELISP@")
#   	(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.csv\\'" . csv-mode))
#   	(autoload 'csv-mode "csv-mode" "Major mode for csv files." t)
#
# If your Emacs support files are installed in a subdirectory of
# /usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/ (which is strongly recommended), you need
# to extend Emacs' load-path as shown in the first non-comment line.
# The elisp-site-file-install() function of this eclass will replace
# "@SITELISP@" and "@SITEETC@" by the actual paths.
#
# The next line tells Emacs to load the mode opening a file ending
# with ".csv" and load functions depending on the context and needed
# features.  Be careful though.  Commands as "load-library" or "require"
# bloat the editor as they are loaded on every startup.  When having
# many Emacs support files, users may be annoyed by the start-up time.
# Also avoid keybindings as they might interfere with the user's
# settings.  Give a hint in pkg_postinst(), which should be enough.
#
# The naming scheme for this site-init file matches the shell pattern
# "[1-8][0-9]*-gentoo*.el", where the two digits at the beginning define
# the loading order (numbers below 10 or above 89 are reserved for
# internal use).  So if your initialisation depends on another Emacs
# package, your site file's number must be higher!
#
# Best practice is to define a SITEFILE variable in the global scope of
# your ebuild (e.g., right after S or RDEPEND):
#
#   	SITEFILE="50${PN}-gentoo.el"
#
# Which is then installed by
#
#   	elisp-site-file-install "${FILESDIR}/${SITEFILE}" || die
#
# in src_install().  Any characters after the "-gentoo" part and before
# the extension will be stripped from the destination file's name.
# For example, a file "50${PN}-gentoo-${PV}.el" will be installed as
# "50${PN}-gentoo.el".  If your subdirectory is not named ${PN}, give
# the differing name as second argument.
#
# .SS
# pkg_postinst() / pkg_postrm() usage:
#
# After that you need to recreate the start-up file of Emacs after
# emerging and unmerging by using
#
#   	pkg_postinst() {
#   		elisp-site-regen
#   	}
#
#   	pkg_postrm() {
#   		elisp-site-regen
#   	}
#
# When having optional Emacs support, you should prepend "use emacs &&"
# to above calls of elisp-site-regen().
# Don't use "has_version virtual/emacs"!  When unmerging the state of
# the emacs USE flag is taken from the package database and not from the
# environment, so it is no problem when you unset USE=emacs between
# merge and unmerge of a package.
#
# .SS

#
# elisp-emacs-version() outputs the version of the currently active Emacs.

#
# The current directory is added to the load-path.  This will ensure
# that interdependent Emacs Lisp files are visible between themselves,
# in case they require or load one another.
