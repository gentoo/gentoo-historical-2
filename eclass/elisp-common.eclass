All site initialization for Gentoo-installed packages is now added to
/usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/site-gentoo.el; site-start.el is no longer
managed by Gentoo.  You may want to remove the generated
site-start.el.

In order for this site initialization to be loaded for all users
automatically, as was done previously, you can add a line like this:

    (load "/usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/site-gentoo")

to /usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/site-start.el.  Alternatively, that line
can be added by individual users to their initialization files, or for
greater flexibility, users can select which of the package-specific
initialization files in /usr/share/emacs/site-lisp to load.
