# @BLURB: Emacs-related installation utilities
# @DESCRIPTION:
#
# Usually you want to use this eclass for (optional) GNU Emacs support of
# your package.  This is NOT for XEmacs!
#
# Many of the steps here are sometimes done by the build system of your
# package (especially compilation), so this is mainly for standalone elisp
# files you gathered from somewhere else.
#
# When relying on the emacs USE flag, you need to add
#
#   	emacs? ( virtual/emacs )
#
# to your DEPEND/RDEPEND line and use the functions provided here to bring
# the files to the correct locations.
#
# .SS
# src_compile() usage:
#
# An elisp file is compiled by the elisp-compile() function defined here and
# simply takes the source files as arguments.
#
#   	elisp-compile *.el || die "elisp-compile failed"
#
# In the case of interdependent elisp files, you can use the elisp-comp()
# function which makes sure all files are loadable.
#
#   	elisp-comp *.el || die "elisp-comp failed"
#
# Function elisp-make-autoload-file() can be used to generate a file with
# autoload definitions for the lisp functions.  It takes the output file name
# (default: "${PN}-autoloads.el") and a list of directories (default: working
# directory) as its arguments.  Use of this function requires that the elisp
# source files contain magic ";;;###autoload" comments. See the Emacs Lisp
# Reference Manual (node "Autoload") for a detailed explanation.
#
# .SS
# src_install() usage:
#
# The resulting compiled files (.elc) should be put in a subdirectory of
# /usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/ which is named after the first argument
# of elisp-install().  The following parameters are the files to be put in
# that directory.  Usually the subdirectory should be ${PN}, you can choose
# something else, but remember to tell elisp-site-file-install() (see below)
# the change, as it defaults to ${PN}.
#
#   	elisp-install ${PN} *.el *.elc || die "elisp-install failed"
#
# To let the Emacs support be activated by Emacs on startup, you need
# to provide a site file (shipped in ${FILESDIR}) which contains the startup
# code (have a look in the documentation of your software).  Normally this
# would look like this:
#
#   	;;; csv-mode site-lisp configuration
#
#   	(add-to-list 'load-path "@SITELISP@")
#   	(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.csv\\'" . csv-mode))
#   	(autoload 'csv-mode "csv-mode" "Major mode for csv files." t)
#
# If your Emacs support files are installed in a subdirectory of
# /usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/ (which is recommended if more than one file is
# installed), you need to extend Emacs' load-path as shown in the first
# non-comment.  The elisp-site-file-install() function of this eclass will
# replace "@SITELISP@" by the actual path.
#
# The next line tells Emacs to load the mode opening a file ending with
# ".csv" and load functions depending on the context and needed features.
# Be careful though.  Commands as "load-library" or "require" bloat the
# editor as they are loaded on every startup.  When having a lot of Emacs
# support files, users may be annoyed by the start-up time.  Also avoid
# keybindings as they might interfere with the user's settings.  Give a hint
# in pkg_postinst(), which should be enough.
#
# The naming scheme for this site file is "[0-9][0-9]*-gentoo.el", where the
# two digits at the beginning define the loading order.  So if you depend on
# another Emacs package, your site file's number must be higher!
#
# Best practice is to define a SITEFILE variable in the global scope of your
# ebuild (right after DEPEND e.g.):
#
#   	SITEFILE=50${PN}-gentoo.el
#
# Which is then installed by
#
#   	elisp-site-file-install "${FILESDIR}/${SITEFILE}"
#
# in src_install().  If your subdirectory is not named ${PN}, give the
# differing name as second argument.
#
# .SS
# pkg_postinst() / pkg_postrm() usage:
#
# After that you need to recreate the start-up file of Emacs after emerging
# and unmerging by using
#
#   	pkg_postinst() {
#   		elisp-site-regen
#   	}
#
#   	pkg_postrm() {
#   		elisp-site-regen
#   	}
#
# When having optional Emacs support, you should prepend "use emacs &&" to
# above calls of elisp-site-regen().  Don't use "has_version virtual/emacs"!
# When unmerging the state of the emacs USE flag is taken from the package
# database and not from the environment, so it is no problem when you unset
# USE=emacs between merge and unmerge of a package.
#
# .SS
# Miscellaneous functions:
#
# elisp-emacs-version() outputs the version of the currently active Emacs.

All site initialisation for Gentoo-installed packages is added to
/usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/site-gentoo.el; site-start.el is no longer
managed by Gentoo. You are responsible for all maintenance of
site-start.el if there is such a file.

In order for this site initialisation to be loaded for all users
automatically, you can add a line like this:

	(load "/usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/site-gentoo" nil t)

to /usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/site-start.el.  Alternatively, that line
can be added by individual users to their initialisation files, or for
greater flexibility, users can select which of the package-specific
initialisation files in /usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/ to load.
