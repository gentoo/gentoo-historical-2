*xv-3.10a-r2 (05 Jun 2002)

  05 Jun 2002; Olivier Reisch <doctomoe@gentoo.org> xv-3.10a-r2.ebuild
  files/digest-xv-3.10a-r2 :

  Added a patch to the current ebuild that makes the sources build and link
  fine on PPC. The patch is only applied on PPC, so there should be no
  changes in code on other platforms. Fixes BUG #3370.

*xv-3.10a-r2 (29 Apr 2002)

  29 Apr 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> xv-3.10a-r2.ebuild
  files/digest-xv-3.10a-r2 :

  NAZ (from #gentoo) enhanced the patch so that app-shells/tcsh does not have
  to be a compile-time dependency.

*xv-3.10a-r1 (29 Apr 2002)

  29 Apr 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> xv-3.10a-r1.ebuild
  files/digest-xv-3.10a-r1 files/xv-naz-gentoo.patch :

  This patch, submitted by NAZ (from #gentoo) now brings in png, jpeg and tiff
  support.  The only issue is that, if you want support for one of those, you
  get to have support for all of them.  While unfortunate, this unavoidable, due
  to the manner in which xv's Makefiles are laid out.  To think, there actually
  is a configure script.  And also, it's been more than half a decade since
  this package came out -- you'd think the author would issue an upgrade.

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
  
  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
