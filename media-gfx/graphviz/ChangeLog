  10 Nov 2002; George Shapovalov <george@gentoo.org> graphviz-1.8.10-r1.ebuild, files/ :

  removed libpng dependency and made package compile without libpng. 
  Reason: at the moment this is the only app left in portage that depends on libpng-1.0 
  series (often won't compile against 1.2) and libpng-1.0 is creating a lot of trouble 
  for example with kdelibs. See #10726 for details.

  10 Nov 2002; George Shapovalov <george@gentoo.org> graphviz-1.8.10.ebuild :
   new version.
   Fixes some weird issue, possibly libpng related. This app still depends on libpng-1.0.x!!
   Corrected the dependency. See #9702 for more details.
