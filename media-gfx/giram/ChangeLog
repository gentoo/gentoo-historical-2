*giram-0.3.3 (23 July 2002)

  23 Jyly 2002; Thomas Otvald Jensen <otvald@hotmail.com> ChangeLog :
  
  Initial release...

  This is my very first ebuild package, so please be gentle if something
  obvious-for-the-expert-guru is missing.

  I have added two additional "USE" flags for building: 'bishop3d' and 'vik'.
  I don't think anyone will need it, but it's there!
