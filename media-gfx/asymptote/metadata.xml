		Asymptote is a powerful descriptive vector graphics language that
		provides a natural coordinate-based framework for technical drawing.
		Labels and equations are typeset with LaTeX, for high-quality PostScript
		output.

		A major advantage of Asymptote over other graphics packages is that it
		is a programming language, as opposed to just a graphics program.
