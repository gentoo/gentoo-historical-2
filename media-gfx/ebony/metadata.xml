Ebony is a tools for Enlightenment that creates special bits called "bg.db"s, or 
background bits. Because Enlightenment uses eBits for anything and everything 
related to graphics layout we also use them to design and display our wallpaper. 
Rather than simply using scaled images like in previous versions, you can use 
Ebony to design background bits much like Etcher, including layering, relative 
positioning, tiling, and much more. The big advantage is that using Ebony you can 
have exceptional flexibility in your wallpaper design.

No longer do you need to create 5 versions of the same background to make it look 
properly on diffrent resolutions. Now you can lay images together in layers, that 
position themselves based on the users screen and not your own. This way your 
designs look as perfect on a 1024x768 desktop as they do on a 3840x1024 trihead.
