  +files/replicatorg, +metadata.xml:
  Initial Commit - replicatorg is open source software and a required tool when
  working with common 3d printers such as the makerbot replicator.
  Unfortunately it is based on java and focused on cross platform binaries. But
  the initial install here does work and isnt that bad for what it is.
