*gnuplot-3.8j (08 Feb 2004)

  08 Feb 2004; Grant Goodyear <g2boojum@gentoo.org> gnuplot-3.7.1-r3.ebuild,
  gnuplot-3.7.2.ebuild, gnuplot-3.7.3-r1.ebuild, gnuplot-3.7.3.ebuild,
  gnuplot-3.8j.ebuild, metadata.xml:
  Old versions fail to build due to some libpng setjmp weirdness that
  I don't understand.  I've added a new version that builds just fine
  (on x86, at least), and is much less out-of-date.  I've also removed
  the versions that don't build.
