Etcher is a graphical editing tool for creating and manipulating Ebits GUI 
elements. Just as an example, the window borders currently used in E17 were 
created with Etcher.
Using Etcher you can arrange various images, and define their behavior when the 
GUI element is resized. Etcher is not a drawing program. Etcher-made GUI elements 
can be used by any application that uses the Ebits library.
