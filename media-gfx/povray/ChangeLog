*povray-3.1g-r4 (19 Apr 2002)

  12 Apr 2002; William McArthur <sandymac@gentoo.org>

  Fixed povray to use system versions of libpng and zlib. PovRay wasn't using
  newest libpng despite the change entry below.
  
  Changed the CFLAGS in the makefile to be similar to the ones in the systems
  /etc/make.conf . This is kinda ugly but it doesn't hard code the CFLAGS for 
  pentium 2.

  Added icc support. This is also ugly but there are real speed increases to be
  gained. To use icc you need to add "icc" to your USE variable. My benchmarks
  show that using icc gives a 5% speed increase on a pentium 2.

  Added icc Profile-guided Optimization (PGO) support. To use PGO you need to
  add "icc-pgo" to your USE variable. Then merge the package, run it some to
  collect profile data, and merge it again useing that profile data. PGO is a
  two step process, so it requires that the user merge the package twice. In
  step one the icc compiles the package with "-prof_gen" in the CFLAGS. Then
  icc adds code in the application to collect stats on the execution flow of the
  program. Unfortunatlly there is about a 30% performance hit but the performace
  gains later are worth it. After you've run the program a some, the more you do
  the better the collected stats, you recompile with "-prof_use". The resulting
  binary is optimized based on your use of the program. In my benchmarks the PGO
  binary was 21.7% faster that the gcc version and 15.8% faster than the non-PGO
  icc version. If you want to recollect the PGO data delete the
  /var/tmp/portage/povray-3.1g-r4/icc-pgo directory. The ebuild detects the
  presence of this directory to decide which stage in the PGO process it is in.
