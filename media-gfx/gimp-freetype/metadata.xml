    GIMP-FreeType is a plug-in for The GIMP that uses the freetype2
    library to do font rendering. With GIMP version 2.0, GIMP's text
    rendering has improved a lot and this plug-in became less
    important.  However there are still some things that only this
    plug-in can do; so it may still be useful sometimes.
