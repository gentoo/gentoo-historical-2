  <longdescription>This is a Linux driver for wireless LAN cards based on
  Intersil's Prism2/2.5/3 chipset. The driver supports a so called Host AP mode,
  i.e., it takes care of IEEE 802.11 management functions in the host computer
  and acts as an access point. This does not require any special firmware for
  the wireless LAN card. In addition to this, it has support for normal station
  operations in BSS and possible also in IBSS.</longdescription>
