*ipw2100-0.30 (11 Mar 2004)

  11 Mar 2004; Peter Johanson <latexer@gentoo.org> ipw2100-0.30.ebuild:
  Bump. Includes many minor fixes for various oopses.

*ipw2100-0.29 (10 Mar 2004)

  10 Mar 2004; Peter Johanson <latexer@gentoo.org> ipw2100-0.29.ebuild,
  metadata.xml:
  Initial commitebuild ipw2100-0.29.ebuild digest! Great thanks to Intel for
  finally stepping up and delivering this. Ebuild by me, will be submitting
  better makefiles upstream soon to make life easier. This driver is still in
  development, and does not support WEP or ad-hoc mode yet, but should work for
  basic functionality. Consider yourself warned.
