<longdescription> OpenWrt is a linux distribution for the Linksys
WRT54G. Instead of trying to cram every possible feature into one
firmware, OpenWrt provides only a minimal firmware with support for
add-on packages. For users this means the ability to custom tune
features, removing unwanted packages to make room for other packages and
for developers this means being able to focus on packages without having
to test and release an entire firmware. </longdescription>
