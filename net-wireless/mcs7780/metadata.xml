		MCS7780 is a simple USB to IrDA bridge by MosChip. It is neither
		compatibile with irda-usb nor with stir4200. Although it is quite
		similar to the latter as far as general idea of operation is concerned.
		That is it requires the software to do all the framing job. It supports
		all speeds from 2400 through 4Mbps.
