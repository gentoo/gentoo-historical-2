Blueproxy is a simple proxy server to convert Bluetooth RFCOMM
connections into TCP connections. This frees Bluetooth application
programmers from having to worry about getting Bluetooth bindings for
their language of choice. Notable features include sending preambles
to allow a single TCP server to aggregrate multiple Bluetooth sensors,
and a scanning mode to continuously detect Bluetooth devices entering
into range of a sensor.
