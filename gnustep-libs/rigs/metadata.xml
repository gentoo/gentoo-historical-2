What is RIGS ?
==============

RIGS stands for Ruby Interface for GNUstep. It is a package allowing
integration between Ruby and Objective-C/GNUstep. The main purpose of
RIGS is to allow the use the GNUstep development environment from
Ruby.

One of the most interesting feature of RIGS is that it is 100%
dynamic. It means that RIGS maps Ruby object/methods to GNUstep and
vice/versa entirely on the fly when running the Ruby script. As a
consequence there is no need to generate any kind of wrapping code to
use either existing GNUstep classes or even new ones that you have
developped by yourself. Simply compile your new classes in a shared
library and then do a simple:

require('MyNewClass')       # load your extra ObjC shared library
Rigs.import("MyNewClass")   # dynamically import the class in Ruby

and you are in business! Cool, hey.

RIGS allows you to write optimized classes and components in
Objective-C, and make them available to Ruby developers. Ruby is a
great OO programming language and it is real fun to write GNUstep
applications directly from Ruby.

By the way GNUstep users who don't known Ruby can learn more at
http://www.ruby-lang.org. And Ruby users that don't know about
GNUstep can go to http://www.gnustep.org. In both cases, it's
definitely worth a visit.

RIGS is free software and part of the GNU/GNUstep project, freely
available from the Free Software Foundation under the GNU LGPL
license. (Some sample Ruby scripts are under GPL)
