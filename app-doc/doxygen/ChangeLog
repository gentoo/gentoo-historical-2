  30 Jun 2003; Patrick Kursawe <phosphan@gentoo.org> doxygen-1.3.ebuild:
  Installing docs requires more write permissions, fixed bug 23738

  17 Jun 2003; Will Woods <wwoods@gentoo.org> doxygen-1.2.18.ebuild,
  doxygen-1.3.ebuild:
  Added alpha/~alpha to KEYWORDS

  19 May 2003; Grant Goodyear <g2boojum@gentoo.org> doxygen-1.3.ebuild:
  Sed-fu to make configure work w/ install from either coreutils or fileutils

*doxygen-1.3 (15 Apr 2003)

  15 Apr 2003; Jyrki Muukkonen <jyrki@kruu.org> doxygen-1.3.ebuild:
  - Version bump, ~x86 ~ppc and ~sparc keywords.
  - Updated description
  - Added IUSE="doc qt". With "doc" it builds the HTML and PDF versions of
    the manual, and hence depends on app-text/tetex. HTML version needs latex
    for generating some bitmap formulas and PDF version uses pdftex. Tested
    with tetex-1.0.7-r12 and tetex-2.0.2
  - Change \setlength{\footrulewidth} to \renewcommand{\footrulewidth} in
    doxygen_manual.tex to make it work with tetex-2.x also. Looks like it
    works with tetex-1.x too.
  - Simplified the tmake.conf sed(1) hack and ./configure options.
  - Also made the actual compiling use emake instead of make.
  - And applied by wmertens@gentoo.org, who also added a sandbox violation
    fix for the docs.

*doxygen-1.2.15-r1 (11 May 2002)

  11 Jun 2002; Wout Mertens <wmertens@gentoo.org>:
  Changed qt dependency syntax so Portage wouldn't get weird dependency
  problems. Builds fine with qt3.

  02 Jun 2002; Wout Mertens <wmertens@gentoo.org>:
  Changed ebuild to depend on graphvis as per bug #3320.
  While I was at it, changed it so lintool was happy. Therefore, the Author
  field was removed, and copied to here:
  Author Sean Mitchell <sean@arawak.on.ca>, updated Tom von Schwerdtner
  <tvon@etria.org>

  are supported by the ebuild now

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :

  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
