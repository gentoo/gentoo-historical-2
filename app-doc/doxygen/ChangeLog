*doxygen-1.3 (15 Apr 2003)

  15 Apr 2003; Jyrki Muukkonen <jyrki@kruu.org> doxygen-1.3.ebuild:
  - Version bump, ~x86 ~ppc and ~sparc keywords.
  - Updated description
  - Added IUSE="doc qt". With "doc" it builds the HTML and PDF versions of
    the manual, and hence depends on app-text/tetex. HTML version needs latex
    for generating some bitmap formulas and PDF version uses pdftex. Tested
    with tetex-1.0.7-r12 and tetex-2.0.2
  - Change \setlength{\footrulewidth} to \renewcommand{\footrulewidth} in
    doxygen_manual.tex to make it work with tetex-2.x also. Looks like it
    works with tetex-1.x too.
  - Simplified the tmake.conf sed(1) hack and ./configure options.
  - Also made the actual compiling use emake instead of make.
  - And applied by wmertens@gentoo.org, who also added a sandbox violation
    fix for the docs.
