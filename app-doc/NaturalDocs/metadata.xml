		Natural Docs is an open-source, extensible, multi-language
		documentation generator. It extracts specially formatted comments from
		source code and builds HTML documentation from it. The syntax is
		transparent so that the comments in the source code read just as easily
		as the generated documentation. It also focuses on automation and
		high-quality generated output.
