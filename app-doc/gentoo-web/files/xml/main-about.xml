		<p>
		Gentoo Linux is a fast and modern, completely free x86-based Linux
		distribution with a clean and flexible design. Unlike other distros,
		Gentoo Linux has an advanced package management system called Portage.
		Portage is a true ports system in the tradition of BSD ports, but is
		Python-based and sports a number of advanced features including
		dependencies, fine-grained package management, "fake" (OpenBSD-style)
		installs, safe unmerging, system profiles, virtual packages, config
		file management, and more.
		</p>

		<p>Portage allows you to set up Gentoo Linux the way <e>you</e> like
		it -- with the optimization settings that you want, and with optional
		build-time functionality (like GNOME, KDE, mysql, ALSA, LDAP support,
		etc.) enabled or disabled as you desire.  If you don't want GNOME on
		your system, your apps won't have optional GNOME support enabled, and
		if you do, then they will.  That's why we prefer thinking of Gentoo
		Linux as a <e>meta</e>-distribution or Linux <e>technology engine</e>.
		You decide what kind of system you want, and Portage will create it for
		you.</p>
		
		<p>We maintain an official Gentoo Linux Portage tree that contains
		the most recent versions of our ebuild autobuild scripts.  By updating
		your Portage tree, you gain instant access to the latest and greatest
		Linux technologies and applications.  Tell Portage what ebuild you'd
		like to install, and Portage will auto-download, unpack, patch,
		configure, compile and install the package.  Thanks to Portage
		auto-dependency resolution, you can install of KDE 2.1.1 or GNOME 1.4
		by typing in a single command, and the resultant installed binaries
		will be optimized and customized to your exact specifications.</p>

		<p>If this kind of power and flexibility appeals to you, then we
		encourage you to try Gentoo Linux for yourself.  You won't be
		disappointed.</p>
