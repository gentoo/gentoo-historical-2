<b>We now have a very stable prerelease version of the Gentoo Linux build image available for download, in both
.tbz2 and bootable ISO forms</b>.  Quite a few people have used this technique to create their own Gentoo Linux
1.0_rc6 systems.  While our Portage tree hasn't been 100% updated to work with 1.0_rc6 (we're working on getting
all the initscripts converted over to our new format), most packages <e>will</e> work perfectly.  If you've been
anxiously waiting to run 1.0_rc6, here's your opportunity!
</p>

<p><b>You can find the 1.0_rc6 build images and ISOs at <uri>http://www.ibiblio.org/gentoo/snapshots/build/ix86-linux-gnu</uri>.</b>  If you're using a .tbz2 build image install method, be sure to grab at least <file>build-ix86-1.0_rc6-r7.tbz2</file> or later.  If you're going to use the ISO to install (should work with any modern bootable CD-ROM, IDE or SCSI), be sure to grab <file>build-1.0_rc6-r9.tbz2</file> or later.  You can find installation instructions for the ISO install <uri link="/doc/build.html">here, in the 1.0_rc6 "from source" Installation Guide</uri>.  Right now, we don't have instructions for the .tbz2 install, but the installation process is very similar to that of the ISO, and you should be able to use the ISO docs.  Alll you'll need to do is chroot from an existing Linux 2.4-based distribution rather than the boot CD.  Just perform all the
"before chroot" steps from your existing Linux distro, such as using <c>fdisk</c> and creating and mounting filesystems.  In fact, if your network is already configured under your existing Linux distro, it should continue to work after the chroot, so you can skip most of the network configuration steps needed in order to get emerge rsync to work.  All you'll need to do is to update <path>/mnt/gentoo/etc/resolv.conf</path> (the chrooted <path>/etc/resolv.conf</path>) so that DNS name resolution works properly.
