We are working hard on a new release of Gentoo Linux, but right now, the
1.0_rc4_pre2 release on ibiblio.org and its mirrors is a bit out of date.  If
you're interested in installing Gentoo Linux, we recommend you wait until the
1.0_rc5 release (coming soon to a mirror near you) or install a <uri
link="http://www.ibiblio.org/gentoo/gentoo-x86-distro/gentoo-1.0_rc4/packages/snapshots/">
system snapshot</uri> rather than using the official 1.0_rc4_pre2 version.
You'll find installation <path>README</path>s at the above link, and you can also reach us
on <path>#gentoo</path> or the gentoo-dev mailing list if you have any questions.  Please
note that until version 1.0 is released, Gentoo Linux is geared for developers
only.  The distro is quite refined at this point, but installation requires
some skill.

Currently, we have three different methods of installing Gentoo Linux,
depending on your needs: the install CD method, the system snapshot method and the
build image method.
</p>


<p>
For every official Gentoo Linux release, we create a bootable ISO image that
can be used to install Gentoo Linux.  The process works as follows: you burn
the ISO image using a CD-R, and then boot the CD and are presented with a
minimal CD-based Gentoo Linux system.  You then use this system to create
partitions and set up filesystems as needed.  Once your filesystems are
created, you mount them and extract the system-image (<path>sys.tbz2</path>) tarball
included on the CD, which contains a basic Gentoo Linux system.  After a few
more configuration steps, you can umount your Gentoo Linux partitions and
install a boot manager; Gentoo Linux is now ready to run.  Since our CD releases
include precompiled packages for most applications, they're generally around
600Mb in size.
</p>


<p>
In-between our official Gentoo Linux ISO CD releases, we create up-to-date
sys.tbz2 files, called "system snapshots".  These <path>sys.tbz2</path> files are identical
in design to the <path>sys.tbz2</path> image included on our official CDs, except that they
are more up-to-date and are used by our developers as we are refining a Gentoo
Linux for the next official CD release.  A lot of the time, we'll recommend
that you install a system snapshot rather than our latest official Gentoo Linux
CD release, because our system snapshots are often the most stable and
up-to-date version of Gentoo Linux available.  However, since system snapshots
are for developers only, we don't provide an ISO image; instead, we provide the
<path>sys.tbz2</path> tarball only -- it's up to you to get the tarball extracted to a spare
partition.  However, we will often include bootdisks to make this process
easier, depending on whether or not the system snapshot is truly ready for
prime-time use.  System images average around 70Mb in size.
</p>


<p>
Our third, and possibly most interesting install method uses a "build image",
or <path>build.tbz2</path> file.  This <path>build.tbz2</path> file contains a minimal chrootable Gentoo
Linux environment; you use it by extracting build.tbz2 to a spare partition and
then chrooting to it from an existing Linux system.  Then, you can build a
complete Gentoo Linux system from scratch using Portage -- as well as your
desired optimization settings and compile-time extensions enabled.  Using the
"build image" approach, you can create a complete Gentoo Linux system from
scratch that's set up just the way you want it.
</p>


<p>
However, build image installation is a bit more labor intensive than the other
approaches.  First, you must download the <path>build.tbz2</path> file (typically about 17Mb
in size), extract it to a spare partition, chroot to the build environment, configure
networking, and use emerge to grab the latest version of our Portage tree using
rsync.  Then, you can configure your <path>/etc/make.conf</path> with your desired system-wide
compilation settings, and use a special bootstrap script to automatically rebuild
the system to the point where it's the equivalent to a <path>sys.tbz2</path> file.  At this
point, your Gentoo Linux system is ready to boot on its own.
