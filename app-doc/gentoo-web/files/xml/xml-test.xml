<abstract>This guide shows you how to compose web documentation using the new lightweight Gentoo guide
XML syntax.  This syntax is the official format for Gentoo Linux documentation, and this document
itself was created using guide XML.  This guide assumes a basic working knowledge of XML and HTML.

<p> The guide XML syntax is lightweight yet expressive, so that it is easy to
learn yet also provides all the features we need for the creation of web
documentation.  The number of tags is kept to a minimum -- just those we need.
This makes it easy to transform guide into other formats, such as DocBook
XML/SGML or web-ready HTML.  </p>

<p>The goal is to make it easy to <e>create</e> and <e>transform</e> guide XML
documents.</p>
