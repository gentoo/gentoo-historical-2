<p>Firewalls all good and fun, but what do you do when you need to make rapid,
complex changes to your netfilter-based firewall?  Instead of feverishly
hacking away at a complex master firewall script, use the dynfw Dynamic
Firewall Tools.  This collection of robust bash scripts have been designed to
work with nearly any existing netfilter-based firewall configuration.  By using
these scripts, you'll be able to make near-immediate changes to your firewall
configuration without risk of misconfiguration, resulting in vastly improved
network security and responsiveness.  The dynfw firewall scripts were
originally featured in <uri
link="http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-fw/?n-l-4191">this
IBM developerWorks article</uri>.</p>

<p>You can download the current version of dynfw here:
<uri>dynfw-1.0.tar.gz</uri>.</p>
