<abstract>
Firewalls all good and fun, but what do you do when you need to make rapid,
complex changes to your iptables-based firewall rules?  Easy -- use the dynfw
Dynamic Firewall Tools, a collection of robust bash scripts that are designed
to work with nearly any existing iptables-based firewall configuration.  You
can use these scripts to increase your network security and responsiveness, and
as inspiration for your own creative designs.

<p>The dynfw scripts originated from an article I wrote for <uri link="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks">IBM developerWorks</uri> that showed how to make a firewall more responsive by creating scripts that automate common "firewall-tweaking" tasks,
such as blocking an IP, ratelimiting a host, etc.  The reason for the scripts is simple -- when you're in a crisis, you don't
want to make changes to your master firewall script in a frantic state.  Instead, you want to have an already-existing and
easy-to-use mechanism to make those changes for you, eliminating the possibility of error and allowing immediate response.
<p>You can read <uri link="http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-fw/?n-l-4191">the original IBM developerWorks dynfw article</uri>,
which explains how to use the scripts.</p>
<p>You can download the current version of dynfw here: <uri>dynfw-1.0.tar.gz</uri>.</p>
