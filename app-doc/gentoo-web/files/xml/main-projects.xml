	<b><uri link="/projects/keychain">Keychain</uri> is an extremely handy OpenSSH-compatible RSA/DSA key management
	application for bash.</b> It acts as a front-end to <c>ssh-agent</c>,
allowing you to easily have one long-running <c>ssh-agent</c> process <e>per system</e>,
rather than per login session.  This dramatically reduces the number of times you need
to enter your passphrase from once per new login session to once <e>every time your local
machine is rebooted.</e>

	<p>
	<b><uri link="/projects/dynfw.html">The dynfw firewall scripts</uri> are a collection of netfilter-based
	(<c>iptables</c>) firewall scripts designed to allow for an immediate, measured response against pending
	security threats.</b>  These <c>bash</c> scripts have been designed to work with nearly any netfilter-based firewall
	(including both "allow by default" and "deny by default" configurations).
	</p>

	<p>
	<b><uri link="/projects/xml.html">The XML projects page</uri> contains the complete <c>guide</c> XSLT engine that
	is used to create this entire site, including the main pages and online documentation.</b>  On this page, you
	can find a tarball that contains the complete sources that were used to generate the latest version of 
	the <uri>http://www.gentoo.org</uri> Web site -- the one you are viewing now.
