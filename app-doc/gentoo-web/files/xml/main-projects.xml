	<uri link="/projects/dynfw.html">The dynfw firewall scripts</uri> are a collection of netfilter-based
	(<c>iptables</c>) firewall scripts designed to allow for an immediate, measured response against pending
	security threats.  These <c>bash</c> scripts have been designed to work with nearly any netfilter-based firewall
	(including both "allow by default" and "deny by default" configurations).
