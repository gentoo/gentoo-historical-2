	<title>Getting Started</title>

	<section>
		<title>How is Gentoo pronounced, and what does it mean?</title>
		<body><p>Gentoo is a species of small fast penguin, pronounced "jen-two".</p></body>
	</section>

	<section>
		<title>What makes Gentoo different?</title>
		<body>
			<p>Gentoo Linux is a fast, modern distribution with a clean and flexible design -- in this respect, Gentoo may appeal to <uri link="http://www.slackware.com/">Slackware</uri>, <uri link="http://www.linuxfromscratch.org">Linux From Scratch</uri> or <uri link="http://www.bsd.org">BSD</uri> users. Unlike most Linux distros, Gentoo has a package system reminscient of BSD's ports, meaning the packages are continually updated to the lastest versions.</p></body>

<chapter>
	<title>Installation</title>

	<section>
		<title>What is the differenence between the sys and build tarballs?</title>
		<body><p>The <e>build</e> tarball is a minimal system capable of connecting to the internet and rebuilding itself, whereas <e>sys</e> is a complete comfortable system.</p>
		<note>If you need a minimal system for recovery, you might want to try the bootable <uri link="http://www.ibiblio.org/gentoo/gentoo-x86-distro/gentoo-1.0_rc4/images/">rescue disk images</uri> instead.</note></body>
	</section>

	<section>
		<title>What's the default root password after installation?</title>
		<body><p>The default password is blank; hit enter.</p></body>
	</section>

	<section>
		<title>Why can't a user su to root?</title>
		<body><p>For security reasons, users may only <c>su</c> to root if they belong to the <e>wheel</e> group. To add a <i>username</i> to the <e>wheel</e> group, issue the following command as root:</p>
		<pre># <i>usermod -G users,wheel username</i></pre>
</body>
	</section>

	<section>
		<title>How do I get <path>/dev/dsp</path>?</title>
		<body><p>You can create it by typing the following as root:</p>
		<pre># <i>cd /dev</i>
# <i>./MAKEDEV audio</i></pre></body>

<chapter>
	<title>Package Management</title>
	<section>
		<title>In what format are the packages stored?</title>
		<body><p>They exist in our portage tree as <e>ebuilds</e>; we are primarily a ports-based distribution, meaning that we provide scripts (<c>.ebuild</c> files) and a special system (Portage) so
that you can build apps from sources. We generally only build binaries for releases and snapshots. The <uri link="/doc/gentoo-howto">Development HOWTO</uri> covers the contents of an ebuild script in detail.</p>
		</body>
	</section>

	<section>
		<title>Why write a new port system (Portage) instead of using BSD's version?</title>
		<body>
			<p>One of the design philosophies of the <c>.ebuild</c> syntax was to make it an analog of what you'd type to install the program manually, thus making Portage very easy to learn and modify to your needs.</p>
			<p>Gentoo Linux is designed from the ground up to be as fast as possible; Open, Net and FreeBSD use make for their ports system, which keeps it relativley slow; ebuild is specifcally designed to be small, fast, clean and extensible. Whereas BSD's ports is 
 a relativley unchangable system, Portage can be adapted to your specific needs - Portage is meant to be a working tool, not just a "system" that comes "as-is". It is designed to allow you to interact with it at all levels.</p>
		</body>
	</section>

	<section>
		<title>How does this differ from Debian's apt or BSD's ports?</title>
		<body><p>Portage features the best of apt and ports; for example, USE options, a full dependency system, safe installs and uninstalls, and a true package database.  Think of Portage as the best of both worlds; a ports system with the sensibilities and safety of a package management system built-in.</p></body>
	</section>

	<section>
	        <title>How do I install and uninstall packages?</title>
	        <body>
	                <p>The <uri link="/doc/portage-user.html">Portage User Guide</uri> details how to install and uninstall packages, and update Portage.</p>
	        </body>
	</section>

	<section>
		<title>How can I set a global configuration for compiling packages?</title>
		<body><p><path>/etc/make.conf</path> should be modified to override global and profile-specific default options used to compile and merge packages. The most common options are as follows:</p>
		<table>
		<tr>
			<th>Flag</th>
			<th>Description</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<ti>CHOST</ti>
			<ti>This sets the HOST variable for compiles, e.g. <c>i686-pc-linux-gnu</c></ti>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<ti>CFLAGS</ti>
			<ti>The options for <c>gcc</c> when compiling programs written in C (*.c files)</ti>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<ti>CXXFLAGS</ti>
			<ti>The options for <c>gcc</c> when compiling programs written in C++ (*.c files)</ti>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<ti>USE</ti>
			<ti>This allows you to set what optional components you'd like compiled-in, if available.  For example, if you have <c>gnome</c> inside the USE string, then when you compile <c>xchat</c>, it will include GNOME support.  All our dependencies are also USE-aware.</ti>

		</tr>
		<tr>
			<ti>GENTOO_MIRRORS</ti>
			<ti>A space separated list of uris currently mirroring the Gentoo packages</ti>
		</tr>
		</table>
		</body>
	</section>

	<section>
		<title>What happened to <path>/etc/make.defaults</path>?</title>
		<body><p>As of portage 1.5 onwards, <path>/etc/make.defaults</path> is antiquated -- if you have portage-1.5-r1 or above installed then you can safely delete it. This file has been replaced by <path>/etc/make.profile/make.defaults</path>, which contains system profile-specific default settings. The priority order of the various configuration files is as follows (highest first):
		<ol>
			<li>Environment variables</li>
			<li><path>/etc/make.conf</path> -- for your use</li>
			<li><path>/etc/make.profile/make.defaults</path> -- for profile-specific defaults</li>
			<li><path>/etc/make.globals</path> -- for global defaults (settings not specified in any other place come from ehere)</li>
		</ol></p></body>

	<section>
		<title>Can I rsync from another operating system?</title>
		<body><p>There's a program called unison that works under both UNIX and Win32, available from <uri>http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/unison/</uri>.</p></body>

<chapter>
	<title>Usage</title>
	<section>
		<title>I can start X applications as root only</title>

	<section>
		<title>DNS name resolution works for root only</title>
		<body><p><path>/etc/resolve.conf</path> has the wrong permissions; ,<c>chmod</c> it as follows:</p>
		<pre># <i>chmod 644 /etc/resolve.conf</i></pre>
		</body>
	</section>

	<section>
		<title>Why is KDE not reading <path>/etc/profile</path>?</title>
		<body><p>You need to add <c>--login</c> to the first line in <path>/opt/kde2.1/startkde</path>, so that it reads as follows:</p>
		<pre>#!/bin/sh --login</pre>
		</body>
