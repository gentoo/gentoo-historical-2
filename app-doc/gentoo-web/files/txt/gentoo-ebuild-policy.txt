Intro
The gentoo-ebuild mailing list is for submissions of new ebuilds and ebuild
updates by authors without developer accounts. It is also the place for
'newbie' ebuild-creation related questions. Bug reports which do not suggest
a fix and all other questions and discussions should go on the
general-purpose gentoo-dev mailing list.

Posting rules
The submission posts should include short descriptions of the ebuild/update
etc. and any other relevant information. The ebuilds should be attached to
the posts; updates should be posted as unified-format diffs. Updates
affecting multiple files can be posted in one diff to be applied in
/usr/portage or in a category dir. If the diff becomes as large as the ebuild
itself, you can post the new version of the ebuild instead of the diff, but
it's still deprecated.

What happens to submissions
A developer (currently myself) routinely adds submissions posted on
gentoo-ebuild to incoming. This is the directory /usr/portage/incoming. The
developer also adds a public item to dev-wiki (cvs.gentoo.org/wiki) for the
appropriate team, low priority, unstable branch for new ebuilds and all
branches for updates. A developer from that team will eventually 'grab' the
todo item, check the ebuild, and put it in the appropriate category.

Note: The files in incoming can be accessed via cvs/rsync, but users
shouldn't merge files from incoming, as they haven't been checked by
developers.
