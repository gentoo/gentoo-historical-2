*log4c-1.0.6 (2 May 2002)

  2 May 2002; Matthew Kennedy <mkennedy@gentoo.org> ChangeLog,
  log4c-1.0.6.ebuild, files/digest-log4c-1.0.6 :
  
  New ebuild.

  Log4c is a library of C for flexible logging to files, syslog and
  other destinations. It is modeled after the Log for Java library
  (http://jakarta.apache.org/log4j/), staying as close to their API as
  is reasonable.
