DESCRIPTION="Log4c is a library of C for flexible logging to files, syslog and other destinations. It is modeled after the Log for Java library (http://jakarta.apache.org/log4j/), staying as close to their API as is reasonable."

# This is the last version of log4c that uses 'expat' and the last one I could
# get working with a gcc 3.3.4 gentoo box.  Later version work okay on 
# redhat boxes, but the ones I had around we're gcc 3.2.  The virtual/logger
# could probably be deleted, but it just doesn't seem right to have log4c
# without a logger underneath it.
