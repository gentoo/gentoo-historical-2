 	help
 	  If you answer Y here, the uClibc native shared library loader will
 	  support ET_DYN/PIE executables.
 	  It requires binutils-2.14.90.0.6 or later and the usage of the
 	  -pie option.
-	  More about ET_DYN/PIE binaries on <http://pageexec.virtualave.net/> .
+	  More about ET_DYN/PIE binaries on <http://pax.grsecurity.net/> .
 	  WARNING: This option also enables FORCE_SHAREABLE_TEXT_SEGMENTS, so all
 		libraries have to be built with -fPIC or -fpic, and all assembler
 		functions must be written as position independent code (PIC).
