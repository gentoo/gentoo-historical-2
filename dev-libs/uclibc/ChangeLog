*uclibc-0.9.21 (10 Sep 2003)

  10 Sep 2003; <solar@gentoo.org> uclibc-0.9.21.ebuild:
  andersee is pleased to announce the immediate availability of uClibc 0.9.21.
  This release has been brewing for several months now, and provides quite a lot
  of additional functionality as well as quite a few bug fixes. The biggest
  thing in this release (and I do mean that literally) is that uClibc now has
  full ANSI/ISO C99 locale support. The most interesting thing for uClinux are
  the additional config options that will let you tune the library to be even
  smaller, for example, by disabling all the strerror() messages.
