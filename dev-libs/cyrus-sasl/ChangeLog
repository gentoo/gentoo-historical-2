*cyrus-sasl-1.5.27 (18 Feb 2002)

  18 Feb 2002; Donny Davies <woodchip@gentoo.org>:
  
  Initial checkin of this package.  Postfix now compiles with this
  library by default, and I have tested successfully with *outbound*
  smtp authentication.  Should you discover a bug, or any issues with
  *inbound* authentication, lemme know.
