The Portable Coroutine Library (PCL) implements the low level functionality for coroutines. Coroutines are a very simple cooperative multitasking environment where the switch from one task to another is done explicitly by a function call. Coroutines are a lot faster than processes or threads switch, since there is no OS kernel involvement for the operation. Also coroutines require much less OS resources than processes of threads.
