*log4cpp-0.3.4b (27 Nov 2002)

  27 Nov 2002; George Shapovalov <george@gentoo.org> log4cpp-0.3.4b.ebuild, files/digest-log4cpp-0.3.4b :
 
  New ebuild.
  Log4cpp is library of C++ classes for flexible logging to files, syslog, IDSA and other destinations. 
  It is modeled after the Log4j Java library, staying as close to their API as is reasonable.
