The purpose of the SurakWare Base Library (SWL/libswl) is to serve as a platform
independent framework for C++ and QPascal. The SWL includes both thin layers
over functionality exposed by the Linux and Windows operating systems as well as
higher level classes for many purposes. Save for a few exceptions, the SWL is
completely indpedenent from the STL and the C/C++ runtime library. Platform
independence has been achieved by encapsulating OS-specific implementation
details in a number of SWL classes. There should never be a need to use
"#ifdef"s to distinguish between platforms.
