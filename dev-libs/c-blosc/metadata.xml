  Blosc is a compression library designed to transmit data to the
  processor cache faster than the traditional non-compressed memory fetch. 
  Compression ratios are not very high, but the decompression is very
  fast. Blosc is meant not only to reduce the size of large datasets on-disk
  or in-memory, but also to accelerate memory-bound computations.
