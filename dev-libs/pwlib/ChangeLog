*pwlib-1.3.3 (20 Jul 2002)

  22 Jul 2002; Nick Hadaway <raker@gentoo.org> files/opts.diff :

  Added a patch to remove unix makefile optimizations to allow the users
  make.conf to set the appropriate optimization flags.  Closes bug #5413.

  20 Jul 2002; Nick Hadaway <raker@gentoo.org>
  pwlib-1.3.3.ebuild, file/digest-pwlib-1.3.3 :

  Updated to pwlib version that matches the gnomemeeting-0.93 install.
  Removed all previous version from cvs.  Re-SLOT'ed to 0.

*pwlib-1.2.19 (05 Jul 2002)

  05 Jul 2002; Nick Hadaway <raker@gentoo.org> pwlib-1.2.19.ebuild:
  openh323.org no longer has 1.2.x series available for download.
  This is a download from gnomemeeting.org.  The patch for 1.2.20
  has also been used for this build and seems to work fine.

#pwlib-1.3.2 (05 Jul 2002)

  05 Jul 2002; Nick Hadaway <raker@gentoo.org> pwlib-1.3.2.ebuild:
  Version bump.  This time it compiles beautilfully with gcc-3.1.

*pwlib-1.3.1 (03 Jul 2002)

  03 Jul 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> New version of pwlib that
  works with gcc 3.1.  Needs additional testing, so masking for now.

*pwlib-1.2.13 (29 Mar 2002)

  29 Mar 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> pwlib-1.2.13.ebuild : I was
  careless and did not check the SRC_URI.  The package name in the .12 ebuild
  was hardcoded, so that's the one that got fetched anyway.  Thanks to
  lostlogic for catching and reporting this.  And now, the ebuild can simply be
  renamed for future version bumps.

*pwlib-1.2.13 (28 Mar 2002)

  28 Mar 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> pwlib-1.2.13.ebuild :
  Version bump, and the patch has been renamed to allow it to work with both
  pacakge versions, and the patch has been augmented to include the <stdio.h>
  lib.  This fix, provided by vikingo <gabriel@elvikingo.com.ar> on the
  gentoo-user list, allows for successful compilation of pwlib again.
