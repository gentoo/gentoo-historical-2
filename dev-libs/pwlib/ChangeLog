*pwlib-1.2.13 (29 Mar 2002)

  29 Mar 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> pwlib-1.2.13.ebuild : I was
  careless and did not check the SRC_URI.  The package name in the .12 ebuild
  was hardcoded, so that's the one that got fetched anyway.  Thanks to
  lostlogic for catching and reporting this.  And now, the ebuild can simply be
  renamed for future version bumps.

*pwlib-1.2.13 (28 Mar 2002)

  28 Mar 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> pwlib-1.2.13.ebuild :
  Version bump, and the patch has been renamed to allow it to work with both
  pacakge versions, and the patch has been augmented to include the <stdio.h>
  lib.  This fix, provided by vikingo <gabriel@elvikingo.com.ar> on the
  gentoo-user list, allows for successful compilation of pwlib again.
