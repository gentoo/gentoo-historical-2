*pwlib-1.2.13 (29 Mar 2002)

  29 Mar 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> pwlib-1.2.13.ebuild :

  I was careless and did not check the SRC_URI.  The package name in the .12
  ebuild was hardcoded, so that's the one that got fetched anyway.  Thanks
  to lostlogic for catching and reporting this.  And now, the ebuild can
  simply be renamed for future version bumps.

*pwlib-1.2.13 (28 Mar 2002)

  28 Mar 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> pwlib-1.2.13.ebuild :

  Version bump, and the patch has been renamed to allow it to work with
  both pacakge versions, and the patch has been augmented to include the 
  <stdio.h> lib.  This fix, provided by vikingo <gabriel@elvikingo.com.ar>
  on the gentoo-user list, allows for successful compilation of pwlib again.
