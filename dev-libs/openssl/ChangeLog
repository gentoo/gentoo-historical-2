  21 Mar 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> : Fixed 0.9.6c ebuild so
  that it doesn't do 'sed -e "foo" | cat > Makefile', which breaks often.  Now
  it is a standard 2-liner.

  21 Mar 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> openssl-0.9.6c.ebuild :
  Fixed so that html documentation is no longer gzipped.  Small enough to not
  warrant a revision bump on the ebuild.

*openssl-0.9.6c (1 Feb 2002)

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
  
  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
