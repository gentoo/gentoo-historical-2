  04 Aug 2002; Doug Goldstein <cardoe@gentoo.org> gmp-4.1-r1.ebuild :
  
  Stuart changed more then just make to emake.. He changed ./configure to econf
  and forgot to remove the params which are automatically defined by econf so
  the package failed to compile on all systems.. (*cough* test your ebuilds
  before commiting *cough*)

  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
