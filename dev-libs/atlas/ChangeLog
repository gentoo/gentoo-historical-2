*atlas-3.4.1 (12 Mar 2003)

  12 Mar 2003; George Shapovalov <george@gentoo.org> atlas-3.4.1.ebuild :
  new version (#16218)
  some cleanups, also removed Maintainer field from the ebuild and moved it here:
  ebuild submitted by Nathaniel C. Domingo <nathaniel.domingo@up.edu.ph>
  Also removed the "initial ChangeLog" block of text from the bottom of file, 
  as that only belongs to skel.ChangeLog (and contains no usefull inormation)
