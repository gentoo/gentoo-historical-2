  11 Apr 2002; Karl Trygve Kalleberg <karltk@gentoo.org> aterm-1.6.6.ebuild files/digest-aterm-1.6.6:

  ATerm (short for Annotated Term) is an abstract data type designed for the 
  exchange of tree-like data structures between distributed applications.

  The ATerm library forms a comprehensive procedural interface which enables
  creation and manipulation of ATerms in C and Java. The ATerm implementation 
  is based on maximal subterm sharing and automatic garbage collection.

  A binary exchange format for the concise representation of ATerms (sharing 
  preserved) allows the fast exchange of ATerms between applications. In a 
  typical application---parse trees which contain considerable redundant 
  information---less than 2 bytes are needed to represent a node in memory, 
  and less than 2 bits are needed to represent it in binary format. The 
  implementation of ATerms scales up to the manipulation of ATerms in the 
  giga-byte range.
