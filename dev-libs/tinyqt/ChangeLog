  files/digest-tinyqt-3.0.3
  
  Upgraded to version 3.0.3 and moved to the dev-libs category instead.
  
*tinyqt-3.0.1 (22 Feb 2002)

  22 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> :
  
  Stripped down Qt 3 to support everything that's needed to do commanline
  development without any GUI classes. Thus providing a nice C++ framework
  for console applications without having to resort to STL or other bloatware.
