Xapian is an Open Source Probabilistic Information Retrieval library, released
under the GPL. It's written in C++, with bindings to allow use from Perl,
Python, PHP, Java, TCL, C#, and Ruby (so far!)

Xapian is designed to be a highly adaptable toolkit to allow developers to
easily add advanced indexing and search facilities to their own applications.
