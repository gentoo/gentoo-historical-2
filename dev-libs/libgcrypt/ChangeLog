*libgcrypt-1.1.12 (08 Feb 2003)

  08 Feb 2003; J Robert Ray <jrray@gentoo.org> libgcrypt-1.1.12 : Version bump,
  all the docbook-sgml-utils issues should be sorted out.  The configure script
  needs a working docbook environment or else it prints out a warning, then
  goes on to never actually use it.  Since it is conceivable that it may be
  used or needed in the future, I'm leaving the dependencies in place for now.

*libgcrypt-1.1.10 (4 Feb 2003)

  04 Feb 2003; Yannick Koehler <ykoehler@gentoo.org> libgcrypt-1.1.10.ebuild
  files/digest-libgcrypt-1.1.10 :

  Version bump.

  03 Jan 2003; Matthew Turk <satai@gentoo.org> :
  Changed docbook2X dependency to docbook-sgml-utils, as both have the same
  results and docbook-sgml-utils is more dependable, although I can't really
  tell where the docbook2X system is used in this.

  06 Dec 2002; Rodney Rees <manson@gentoo.org> : changed sparc ~sparc keywords
 
*libgcrypt-1.1.8 (12 Oct 2002)

  12 Oct 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> libgcrypt-1.1.8.ebuild
  files/digest-libgcrypt-1.1.8 :

  Version bump.  License is now LGPL-2.1 unless using a unix without
  /dev/random or windows, in which case use GPL-2.  Removed myconf settings 
  from 1.1.3 since README mentioned nothing about them.  Added docs in 
  src_install.

*libgcrypt-1.1.3 (15 Mar 2002 )
