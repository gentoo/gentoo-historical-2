  clens is a convenience library to aid in porting code from OpenBSD
  to different operating systems. Operating systems traditionally have
  different enough APIs that porting code is painful and can litter
  pretty code with ugly #ifdef goo. In order to keep code readable and
  drastically reduce the number of #ifdefs needed, clens brings other
  APIs or missing functions into specific OS "focus".
