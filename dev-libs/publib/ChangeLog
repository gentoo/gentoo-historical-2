  26 Feb 2002; Chris Houser <chouser@gentoo.org> publib-0.31.ebuild
	 files/digest-publib-0.31 ChangeLog :

  Renamed the man pages to section "o" to avoid collision with more
  standard man page names.  Polished up the ebuild, added ChangeLog
  and checked in to ebuild tree.

  This closes bug 596.  Thanks Ilian Zarov!


  7 Feb 2002; Ilian Zarov <coder@descom.com> publib-0.31.ebuild :

  Initial ebuild for Gentoo.

  Publib is a library of C functions for various purposes. It has been
  written so that it is easy to extend. It's build tools can easily be
  used for other libraries.

  The library contains functions for memory allocation, bit arrays,
  configuration files, comparing standard C types for qsort and
  bsearch, error messages, expression parsing and evaluation,
  filenames, hash tables, integer sets, log files, the Linux Software
  Map, NNTP, priority queues, normal queues, editor buffers, stacks,
  and strings.
