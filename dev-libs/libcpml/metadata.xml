		CPML enables customers to significantly increase the precision and
		speed of mathematical calculations by more than 10 times compared to
		other mathematical libraries currently available on Linux. The Compaq
		Portable Math Library (CPML) is identical in content to that of Compaq
		Tru64 UNIX libm and consequently can be considered as a replacement for
		the Linux Alpha Libm.  In particular the CPML provides intrinsic
		function support for the C and Fortran languages as defined by the
		X/Open, ANSI C and ANSI Fortran standards. The CPML supports IEEE
		single, double and quad precision floating point formats.

		The standard CPML routines are significantly faster than the
		corresponding routines in the Linux Alpha libm and with a few
		exceptions are also faster than the corresponding libffm routines.
