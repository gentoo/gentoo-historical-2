<use>
	<flag name='iconv'>Use iconv as message loader and transcoder (in general it
	would be possible to use iconv only as message loader and something else
	like icu or the native method as transcoder and vice-versa, but this is a
	less common case and hard to handle).</flag>
	<flag name='icu'>Use ICU as message loader and transcoder. ICU supports over
	180 different encodings and/or locale specific message support.</flag>
	<flag name='libwww'>Use the libwww library for fetching URLs, instead
	of the builtin method.</flag>
	<flag name='threads'>Enable threading support through pthread (or other
	libraries on AIX, IRIX, HPUX, Solars). Highly recommended.</flag>
</use>
