  18 Nov 2003; zhen <zhen@gentoo.org> :
  fix for 22928 as well as 15260 - fixed MAKEOPTS to -j1 because xerces does not
  play nice with multiple build threads.
  Thanks to Kasper.Souren@ircam.fr for the research.

  05 Aug 2003; <zhen@gentoo.org> :
  bumped to -r5 to fix configuration issues. I just used econf/emake instead, no big
  changes. Thanks again to cdlaw@elec.gla.ac.uk

  01 Aug 2003; <zhen@gentoo.org> xerces-c-2.3.0-r3.ebuild:
  I didn't mean to check in the changed -r3, changing back for archival
  purposes. PPlease. use -r4!!!!!!

  01 Aug 2003; <zhen@gentoo.org> xerces-c-2.3.0-r3.ebuild,
  xerces-c-2.3.0-r4.ebuild:
  Fixed the lib installation issues, as well as the probs with /obj being
  installed. The fix was supplied by Colin Law <c.law@elec.gla.ac.uk>, so
  please, give him all of the thanks ;)

  xerces-c-2.3.0-r2.ebuild, xerces-c-2.3.0-r3.ebuild:
  I finially fixed the lib issue. All libs should be installing into /usr/lib.

*xerces-c-2.3.0-r2 (16 Jun 2003)

  16 Jun 2003; <zhen@gentoo.org> xerces-c-2.3.0-r2.ebuild:
  Removed the old xerces-c-2.3.0.ebuild because it was majorly borked. I added a
  simple dolib statement to the -r2 to install the libraries (duh). Thanks to
  Apache XML for their great docs (right, b0rked).

  09 Jun 2003; <zhen@gentoo.org> xerces-c-2.3.0.ebuild:
  Fixed a major prob w/ 2.3.0 installing into /include ::oops::. I marked it
  -x86 -ppc and will await a couple of days before removing it from portage. To
  -r1, I fixed the /include problem, and added the 'doc' use flag, cause there
  are an awful lot of docs.

*xerces-c-2.3.0-r1 (16 Jun 2003)
