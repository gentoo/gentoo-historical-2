  files/digest-DirectFB-0.9.10 :

*DirectFB-0.9.9-r2 (15 Apr 2002)

  15 Apr 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> DirectFB-0.9.9-r2.ebuild :

  Update: still blah.  I have removed the necessity of the libmpeg3 tarball
  at least.  These people need to learn about libtool.  Anyway, by patching
  the Makefile to point it to the static libmpeg3.a file in /usr/lib, it
  emerges fine. Sheesh @ hoops though

  Update: blah, this needs the unpacked libmpeg3 tarball itself.  It seems to 
  completely vomit on an installed libmpeg3. Sigh.

  avi support is broken, and libmpeg3 support is broken as well.  Upstream
  has been made aware of the libmpeg3 issue, so that will hopefully get
  sorted out soon.

*DirectFB-0.9.9-r1 (12 Apr 2002)
  12 Apr 2002; Spider <spider@gentoo.org> DirectFB-0.9.9-r1.ebuild :
  Versionbump, libpng update
 
*DirectFB-0.9.9 (12 Apr 2002)

  12 Apr 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> DirectFB-0.9.9.ebuild :

  Version bump, but avi support is still broken.  Note that the avifile
  USE toggle is now just avi.

*DirectFB-0.9.7 (21 Mar 2002)
  
  21 Mar 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> DirectFB-0.9.7.ebuild :

  HTML documentation need not be gzipped.

*DirectFB-0.9.7 (1 Feb 2002)

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
  
  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
