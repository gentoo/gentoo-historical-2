DirectFB is a thin library that provides hardware graphics acceleration, 
input device handling and abstraction, integrated windowing system with 
support for translucent windows and multiple display layers on top of the 
Linux Framebuffer Device. It is a complete hardware abstraction layer with 
software fallbacks for every graphics operation that is not supported by the 
underlying hardware. DirectFB adds graphical power to embedded systems and 
sets a new standard for graphics under Linux
