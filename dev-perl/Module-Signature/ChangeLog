  Module-Signature-0.44.ebuild:
  Remove ~sparc keyword because dev-perl/math-pari-2.010603 will not build,
  and it will not build because pari-2.1.6 does not build on sparc; See Bug
  87790 for explanation.

*Module-Signature-0.44 (11 Apr 2005)

  11 Apr 2005; Michael Cummings <mcummings@gentoo.org> +metadata.xml,
  +Module-Signature-0.44.ebuild:
  Bugs 88267,88354(ok, that one i created for this), and the one that brought it
  up first, 83789. Here's the sum up: we tell users to use cpan or g-cpan if a
  module isn't in the tree. Fine. But if they do that, they can end up with a
  Module::Signature install because it becoming a silent dep in a lot of places
  to confirm the security/validity of a module installation. At least this way
  we can A) provide an ebuild that we can track/fix and B) we have some minor
  influence in the sanity of their environment. This should override any already
  installed versions and be safe for future uses.
