*Attribute-Handlers-0.78.01 (14 Mar 2005)

  14 Mar 2005; Michael Cummings <mcummings@gentoo.org> metadata.xml,
  +files/Attribute-Handlers-0.78_01.diff, +Attribute-Handlers-0.78.01.ebuild:
  This (hack) ebuild is to provide Attribute-Handlers-0.78_01 and should not be
  DEP'd on at all. This hack patches the last release of this module with the
  version that is provided by the perl core releases. As far back as perl-5.8.4
  Attribute-Handlers-0.78_01 has been provided by the perl core only - the
  external module is no longer maintained seperately, at least not at this time.
  All DEP's on this package have been removed, but as there are users that have
  it installed I have bumped the package with the patch (corrects a croak line)
  so that everyone can be back on a fair playing field.
