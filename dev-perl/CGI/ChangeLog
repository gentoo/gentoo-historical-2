  23 Jul 2003; Michael Cummings <mcummings@gentoo.org> CGI-2.97.ebuild:
  Had confirmation from arch's that this is fine to release. See
  http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/8231 for security bulletin

  cross-site scripting vulnerability in CGI.pm
      

  23 Jul 2003; Michael Cummings <mcummings@gentoo.org> CGI-2.97.ebuild:

  16 Jul 2003; Michael Cummings <mcummings@gentoo.org> CGI-2.97.ebuild:
  CPAN Version bump

  31 May 2003; Michael Cummings <mcummings@gentoo.org> CGI-2.81.ebuild,

*CGI-2.93 (01 May 2003)

  CGI-2.93.ebuild:

*CGI-2.81 (26 Mar 2003)

  26 Mar 2003; <rac@gentoo.org> CGI-2.81.ebuild, CGI-2.91.ebuild:
  We had a situation (bug #18150) where the version of dev-perl/CGI was
  between that in the perl 5.6.1 and the 5.8.0 core.  After discussions
  with dragon, avenj, carpaski, and lostlogic, it seemed most prudent to
  bring the stable standalone CGI.pm version to 2.81 (same as in the
  5.8.0 core).

*CGI-2.78-r3 (26 Mar 2003)

  26 Mar 2003; <rac@gentoo.org> CGI-2.78-r3.ebuild:
  temporary back out #18150 fix until can fix properly

  26 Mar 2003; <rac@gentoo.org> CGI-2.78-r3.ebuild:
  Change perl dependency to <=5.6.1, so as not to overwrite the newer version in
  5.8.0. Due to some technical problems with that, currently using =5.6.1*.
  Thanks to Michael Cummings <mcummings@gentoo.org> in bug #18150.

  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about

  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
