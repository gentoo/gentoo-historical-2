*gtk-perl-0.7008-r1 (4 May 2002)

  4 May 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> gtk-perl-0.7008-r1.ebuild
  files/digest-gtk-perl-0.7008-r1 :

  The perllocal.pod file was being over-written by every single perl module.
  To boot, the path in that file was the ${D} path.  So, the path is sed'd out
  and pkg_postinst() will now append the contents of the module's perllocal.pod
  file to the end of the system's perllocal.pod file.  Many thanks to
  porcano@optonline.net (Anthony Porcano) in bug report #2299 for finding this.
