  files/digest-gtk-perl-0.7008-r3 :

  No more interactivity, and no more gnome libs checking.  The latter fix
  sent in by Phoen][x.  The former closes bug report # 2465 reported by
  ian.c.smith@btinternet.com (Ian Smith)

*gtk-perl-0.7008-r2 (5 May 2002)

  5 May 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> gtk-perl-0.7008-r2.ebuild
  files/digest-gtk-perl-0.7008-r2 :

  Switch to using the perl-module.eclass instead.  This will be adopted by
  all the ebuilds under dev-perl

*gtk-perl-0.7008-r1 (4 May 2002)

  4 May 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> gtk-perl-0.7008-r1.ebuild
  files/digest-gtk-perl-0.7008-r1 :

  The perllocal.pod file was being over-written by every single perl module.
  To boot, the path in that file was the ${D} path.  So, the path is sed'd out
  and pkg_postinst() will now append the contents of the module's perllocal.pod
  file to the end of the system's perllocal.pod file.  Many thanks to
  porcano@optonline.net (Anthony Porcano) in bug report #2299 for finding this.

  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
