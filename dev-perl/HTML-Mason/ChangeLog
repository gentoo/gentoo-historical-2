*HTML-Mason-1.15-r2 (26 Nov 2002)

  26 Nov 2002; Michael Cummings <mcummings@gentoo.org> ChangeLog,
  HTML-Mason-1.15-r2, files/digest-HTML-Mason-1.15-r2 :

  Version bump is because on of the required perl modules, Params-Validate,
  was missing a sub-dep - it would install, but not function correctly, and 
  since it was a dep of HTML-Mason, I'm bumping the chain.

*HTML-Mason-1.15-r1 (21 Nov 2002)

  21 Nov 2002; Michael Cummings <mcummings@gentoo.org> ChangeLog,
  HTML-Mason-1.15-r1, files/digest-HTML-Mason-1.15-r1 :

  Addresses bug 10866 with a rather nasty fix. HTML-Mason wants to delete some
  previously installed files if it detects them, which violates the sandbox.


*HTML-Mason-1.15 (16 Nov 2002)

  16 Nov 2002; Matthew Kennedy <mkennedy@gentoo.org> ChangeLog,

  Version update. Clean up some ChangeLog mess.

  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
