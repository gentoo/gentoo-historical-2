*SOAP-Lite-0.60a-r1 (29 Oct 2004)

  29 Oct 2004; Michael Cummings <mcummings@gentoo.org>
  +files/SOAP-Lite-0.60.a.patch, +SOAP-Lite-0.60a-r1.ebuild:
  This bug was brought to light in bug 69248; the author of SOAP-Lite placed a
  dep for MIME-Parser 6.X during the tranition in maintainers of MIME-tools.
  The 6.X series doesn't really exist, so this has been patched to replace the
  dep on 6.X with the current stable of MIME-tools. In addition, the tests are
  intentionally disabled. Please read the notes in the ebuild as to why.

  27 Sep 2004; Michael Cummings <mcummings@gentoo.org> SOAP-Lite-0.60a.ebuild:
  Corrected MIME-tools dep to the "real" current/latest version, not the
  mislabeled one.
