*AxKit-1.6-r2 (19 Dec 2002)

  19 Dec 2002; Michael Cummings <mcummings@gentoo.org>
  AxKit-1.6-r2.ebuild:

  This is not a fix commit. This is a correction to the deps listed in
  the ebuild, namely the removal of the dups, the making http-ghttp
  optional with libwww-perl as it's backup (per the Makefile.PL), and
  the addition of the mod_perl dep - which it must have.
