	# This patch makes sure CFLAGS are applied properly instead of
	# being runon additions to the previously defined symbol.
	# Attempts to address the problem in bug 16388 without completely
	# losing CFLAGS.  The patch submitted to that bug chose to remove
	# the $ENV{'CFLAGS'}.  With the current state of MakeMaker, this
	# would be a perfectly acceptable choice, because the approach
	# taken here ends up with two sets of CFLAGS in the compile line.
	# However, I believe that it may be more prudent in the long run
	# to try to accommodate what I think the original intention of the
	# Makefile was.  Perhaps on some system with some (maybe future)
	# version of MakeMaker, this would be the only way to convey
	# CFLAGS.  Since duplication of CFLAGS is harmless, I'm going to
	# go with adding the space instead of taking out the $ENV{CFLAGS}.
