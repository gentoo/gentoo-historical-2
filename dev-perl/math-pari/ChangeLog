*math-pari-2.010500-r1 (09 Jul 2003)

  09 Jul 2003; Michael Cummings <mcummings@gentoo.org>
  math-pari-2.010500-r1.ebuild:
  Unfortunately it appears my "elegant" solution to the pari depend doesn't work
  if pari isn't installed first (the DEPEND is not read prior to the SRC_URI as
  I had thought). The new version instead is hard DEPEND'ed against a particular
  version as both versions of app-sci/pari have identical KEYWORDs. This
  should handle bug 24073.
