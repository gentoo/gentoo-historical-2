FLAG (Forensic and Log Analysis GUI) was designed to simplify the process of log
file analysis and forensic investigations. Often, when investigating a large
case, a great deal of data needs to be analysed and correlated. PyFlag uses a
database as a backend to assist in managing the large volumes of data. This
allows PyFlag to remain responsive and expedite data manipulation operations.

Since PyFLAG is web based, it is able to be deployed on a central server and
shared with a number of users at the same time. Data is loaded into cases which
keeps information separated.
