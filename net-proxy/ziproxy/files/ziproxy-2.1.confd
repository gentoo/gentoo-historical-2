# configuraton file for /etc/init.d/ziproxy
#
# you can symlink /etc/init.d/zipproxy to a different name
# and can copy this config to a new file with the same name
# as the symlinked init-script to run multiple instances of
# ziproxy. You have then to change the location for CONFIG
# of course... ;-)

# Full path to ziproxy.conf file (instead of default one).

#CONFIG="/etc/ziproxy.conf"

# Limit incoming connections only from the specified address(es).
# This option has the same meaning, but higher precedence as
# "OnlyFrom=" option in configuration file. Uncomment it
# if you want to set it.
