Xpuyopuyo is a UNIX port of a very big time sink :) . Puyo puyo is a puzzle
game, somewhat like Tetris (but much more involved in strategy), where you
strive to match up four "blobs" of the same color. Each match you make gives
points, and also dumps gray rocks on the opponent which are irritating and
troublesome to get rid of. Multiple matches at a time score more points, and
dump more rocks on the opponent (a quintuple-match will dump around 20 rocks on
the opponent, all at once).
