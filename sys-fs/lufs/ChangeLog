*lufs-0.9.7-r1 (26 Mar 2004)

  26 Mar 2004; Daniel Ahlberg <aliz@gentoo.org> lufs-0.9.7-r1.ebuild:
  Adding support for lufs integrated in kernel. Closing #44835.

*lufs-0.9.7 (26 Nov 2003)

  26 Nov 2003; Wout Mertens <wmertens@gentoo.org> lufs-0.9.7.ebuild :
  Version bump, gcc 3.3.2 build fix.
  This should compile properly for Linux 2.6 hosts. Please test.

*lufs-0.9.6 (28 Sep 2003)

  28 Sep 2003; Wout Mertens <wmertens@gentoo.org> lufs-0.9.6.ebuild :
  Version bump. Also added the local USE flag lufsusermount to allow
  users to mount. Flagged ~x86 for now, please test.
  DEPEND isn't going to get better, since it's hard to get the
  standard configure to not use gnome, for instance.
  
*lufs-0.8.0 (15 Sep 2003)

  15 Sep 2003; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> lufs-0.7.0.ebuild,
  lufs-0.8.0-r1.ebuild, lufs-0.8.0.ebuild, lufs-0.9.3.ebuild,
  lufs-0.9.4.ebuild, lufs-0.9.5.ebuild, files/lufs-0.7.0-init,
  files/lufs-0.8.0-init, files/lufs-0.9.3-init:
  moved to sys-fs

  26 Apr 2003; Wout Mertens <wmertens@gentoo.org> lufs-0.9.5.ebuild :
  Fix sandbox failure for kernel 2.5. No revision bump because it just didn't
  build for 2.5. Fixes #18740, thanks to Jedi/Sector One.

*lufs-0.9.5 (05 Apr 2003)

  05 Apr 2003; Wout Mertens <wmertens@gentoo.org> lufs-0.9.5.ebuild :
  New upstream version, and it builds and works fine on all my test systems,
  and nothing depends on it. Only, if you do ldd /usr/bin/lufsd, you
  get many dependencies, and I want to have them in DEPEND before I
  declare these ebuilds stable.

*lufs-0.9.4 (18 Mar 2003)
  18 Mar 2003; Wout Mertens <wmertens@gentoo.org> lufs-0.9.4.ebuild :
  Turns out there was a new upstream version, and the init script and
  lufs user don't make sense any more because the daemon was rewritten.

  18 Mar 2003; Wout Mertens <wmertens@gentoo.org> lufs-0.9.3.ebuild :
  Fixed typo in install, -init was missing from the init script. Didn't
  bump revision since the people that have it running probably
  figured that out by themselves.

*lufs-0.9.3 (12 Feb 2003)

  12 Feb 2003; Luca Barbato <lu_zero@gentoo.org> lufs-0.9.3.ebuild
  files/digest-lufs-0.9.3 lufs-0.9.3-init
  ebuild submitted by Fred Point <fpoint@club-internet.fr>
  
*lufs-0.8.0-r1 (24 Nov 2002)

  24 Nov 2002; Matt Keadle <mkeadle@gentoo.org> lufs-0.8.0-r1.ebuild
  files/digest-lufs-0.8.0-r1

  Fixed a symlink creation that has it's parameters reversed.

*lufs-0.8.0 (20 Nov 2002)

  20 Nov 2002; Daniel Ahlberg <aliz@gentoo.org> :
  Initial import.

*lufs-0.7.0 (01 Nov 2002)

  20 Nov 2002; Daniel Ahlberg <aliz@gentoo.org> lufs-0.7.0.ebuild :
  Fixed a typo, updated HOMEPAGE. Jan Andersson <janneand@yahoo.com> in #10992 found the typo.
  Repoman:ed and lintool:ed.

  01 Nov 2002; Daniel Ahlberg <aliz@gentoo.org> :
  Initial import. Ebuild submitted by Marko Mikulicic <marko@seul.org> in #7314.
