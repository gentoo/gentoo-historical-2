This project provides a device driver allowing 3rd-party (userland) applications
to execute file access control. It was originally developed by H+BEDV
Datentechnik GmbH to allow on-access virus scanning. Other uses include a
file-access monitor/logger or external security implementations. It operates by
intercepting file access calls and passing the file information to a 3rd-party
application. The 3rd-party application then has the opportunity to tell the
device driver to allow or deny the file access. The 3rd-party application also
receives information about the access event, such as accessed file, type of
access, process id, and user id.
