To complete installation you need to perform the following steps:

  1) Create drupal database
  2) Load drupal database scheme
  3) Configure drupal base options
  4) Add drupal entry to cron

1 - Creating drupal database

   These instructions are for MySQL.  If you are using another database,
   check the database documentation.  In the following examples,
   "dba_user" is an example MySQL user which has the CREATE and GRANT
   privileges.  You will need to use the appropriate user name for your
   system.

   First, you must create a new database for your Drupal site:

     $ mysqladmin -u dba_user -p create drupal

   MySQL will prompt for the dba_user database password and then create
   the initial database files.  Next you must login and set the access
   database rights:

     $ mysql -u dba_user -p

   Again, you will be asked for the dba_user database password.  At the
   MySQL prompt, enter following command:

     GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON drupal.*
        TO nobody@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'password';

   where

    'drupal' is the name of your database
    'nobody@localhost' is the userid of your webserver MySQL account
    'password' is the password required to log in as the MySQL user

   If successful, MySQL will reply with

     Query OK, 0 rows affected

   to activate the new permissions you must enter the command

     flush privileges;

   and then enter '\q' to exit MySQL.


2 - Load the drupal database scheme

   Once you have a database, you must load the required tables:

     $ mysql -u nobody -p drupal < database/database.mysql


3 - Configure drupal base options

   Drupal server options are specified in includes/conf.php.

   Before you can run Drupal, you must set the database URL and the
   base URL to the web site.  Open the configuration file and edit the
   $db_url line to match the database defined in the previous steps:

     $db_url = "mysql://username:password@localhost/drupal";

   Set $base_url to match the address to your web site:

     $base_url = "http://www.example.com";


4 - Add drupal entry to cron

   Many Drupal modules have periodic tasks that must be triggered by a
   cron job.  To activate these tasks, you must call the cron page;
   this will pass control to the modules and the modules will decide
   if and what they must do.

   The following example crontab line will activate the cron script
   on the hour:

   0    *   *   *   *   wget -O - -q http://${VHOST_HOSTNAME}/cron.php
