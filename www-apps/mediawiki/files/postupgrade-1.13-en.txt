These instructions help you to upgrade your mediawiki installation.

Please NOTE: at this point it is supposed that you've already read
RELEASE-NOTES and done full wiki backup, as described here:
http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Backing_up_a_wiki


Run the update script
=====================

Note: Make sure there's an AdminSettings.php file in the wiki root, and it
contains up to date information. The user needs full permissions (shell
access) on the database. If there is no AdminSettings.php, create it:

$ cd ${MY_INSTALLDIR}
$ cp AdminSettings.sample AdminSettings.php

Now edit AdminSettings.php.

The preferred method of performing the update is using the command-line
maintenance script, although it is also possible to re-run the web-based
installer. To run command-line maintenance script, change to the maintenance
directory and execute the update script:

$ cd ${MY_INSTALLDIR}/maintenance
$ php update.php

MediaWiki will inspect the existing schema and update it to work with the new
code, adding tables and columns as needed.

Upgrade extensions
==================

Certain extensions have been updated in order to work with MediaWiki 1.13. Be
sure to upgrade to the latest versions of such extensions. You might need to
perform manual updates to custom extensions.


Test the update
===============

Once the upgrade has completed, browse to the wiki and check basics such as
viewing and editing pages to ensure things still work as expected.

Visit Special:Version and check that the version shown is correct.
