Completing setup:

To complete installation cd into the MediaWiki install location, but
make sure to start mysql first with:

$ /etc/init.d/mysql start

$ cd /var/www/localhost/htdocs/mediawiki/

The host directory, localhost, may change depending on your installation.

Then temporarily make the MediaWiki /config directory writable
to the  user the web server is running as. The quickest way is 
to make  the directory world writable.  For example:

$ chmod a+w config
 
Then access it, for example:

lynx http://localhost/mediawiki/config/
 
After setup move the newly created LocalSettings.php from the config/
directory to the main mediawiki directory, for example:
  
$ mv config/LocalSettings.php .

    Remember to restore safe permissions to the MediaWiki config/ and
    LocalSettings.php (which contains clear-text passwords).
    chmod a-w config
    chmod ug=r,o=  LocalSettings.php
    chown root:apache LocalSettings.php

After these steps MediaWiki should be accesable at
http://localhost/mediawiki/
 
Enabling Optional Features:

If you wish to enable image uploads then you must manually edit the
LocalSettings.php file to uncomment the \$wgEnableUploads line.  
If MediaWiki was built with the imagemagick USE-flag the directory
permissions are correct, otherwise you must install ImageMagick and
also adjust permissions on the images directory to allow the server
to write.  For example:
 
$ chown apache:apache /var/www/localhost/htdocs/mediawiki/images

Math Support:

If you wish to enable the math support then you must manually edit" 
the LocalSettings.php file to uncomment the \$wgUseTeX line.
MediaWiki must have been built with the math USE-flag enabled or the
necessary support executable will not be present.
You may also have to execute

$ texconfig dvips printcmd -

if you have not configured tetex before.
