Install Instructions
====================

To complete the install, run this commands:

	trac-admin ${MY_HOSTROOT}/trac/<project-name> initenv

To add security, create a password database.  This command is for Apache 2;
adjust for the webserver of your choice.

	htpasswd2 -c ${MY_HOSTROOT}/trac.passwd <user>

Now, all you need to do is to configure your webserver.  This would go
into Apache's .htaccess file; adjust for the webserver of your choice.

	<Location "/cgi-bin/trac.cgi">
		SetEnv TRAC_ENV ${MY_HOSTROOT}/trac/<project-name>
	</Location>
	<Location "/cgi-bin/trac.cgi/login">
		AuthType Basic
		AuthName "trac"
		AuthUserFile ${MY_HOSTROOT}/trac.passwd
		Require valid-user
	</Location>
