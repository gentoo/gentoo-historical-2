You are almost done!

  0. Setup the db.

  1. Restart Apache

  2. Login on http://${VHOST_HOSTNAME}${VHOST_APPDIR} 
  and finish the installation. IMPORTANT: the web
  installer will complain that configuration.php is not writeable. When you
  are done, create configuration.php in ${MY_INSTALLDIR} and copy the generated
  configuration into it. Then execute the following:
  # cd ${MY_INSTALLDIR}
  # chown apache:apache configuration.php
  # chmod u+w configuration.php

  CONFIGURE MOS

  You can now launch your browser and point it to your MOS site e.g.

  http://www.mysite.com -> Main Site
  http://www.mysite.com/administrator -> Admin

  You can log into Admin using the username 'admin' along with the
  password that was generated or you chose during the web based install.

  Enjoy Mambo!
