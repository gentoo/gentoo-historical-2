You are almost done!

You will need to provide a database for your ${PN} installation.

This assumes you have some knowledge of MySQL, and already have it
installed and configured. If not, please refer to the Gentoo MySQL
guide at the following URL:

http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/mysql-howto.xml

Once you have a database ready all you need to do is to go to this 
location

http://${VHOST_HOSTNAME}/${VHOST_APPDIR}/install.php

and provide the credentials required for the database access.

After the setup you can launch your browser and point it to your S{PN}
site e.g.

http://${VHOST_HOSTNAME}/${VHOST_APPDIR} -> Main Site
http://${VHOST_HOSTNAME}/${VHOST_APPDIR}/administrator -> Admin

You can log in as administrator using the username 'admin' along with the
password that was generated or you chose during the web based installation.

If your site is working fine you should ensure you secure your installation
by removing the "installation" directory from the installed web application:

  rm -rf ${MY_INSTALLDIR}/installation

Enjoy ${PN}!
