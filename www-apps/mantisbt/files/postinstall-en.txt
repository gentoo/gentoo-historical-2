Please edit ${MY_INSTALLDIR}/config_inc.php to configure Mantis for your
system.

If this a first time install, you must create the mantis database and then
execute ${MY_SQLSCRIPTSDIR}/mysql/${PVR}_create.sql
via mysql to create the tables. If you are upgrading from an earlier version
you can use the upgrade scripts at admin/ to execute the pending database
updates.

Check your installation: http://${VHOST_HOSTNAME}/${PN}/admin
Then log in: administrator/root.

After you've finished these steps, please delete the admin/ directory.
