Please edit ${MY_INSTALLDIR}/config_inc.php to configure Mantis for your
system.

If this a first time install, you must create the mantis database and then
execute 

 mysql -u<username> -p<password> <databasename> < ${MY_SQLSCRIPTSDIR}/mysql/${PVR}_create.sql

If you are upgrading from an earlier version, you can use the upgrade scripts
at admin/ to execute the pending database updates.

Check your installation: http://${VHOST_HOSTNAME}/mantisbt/admin
Then log in: administrator/root.
You can load up admin/check.php to see if everything is working correctly.

After you've finished these steps, please delete the admin/ directory.

Don't forget to read the online manual!!!
