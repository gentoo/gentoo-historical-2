Gentoo related gitweb information
=================================

Abstract
--------

gitweb comes with almost no documentation so this document should cover
everything needed to set a gitweb instalation in Gentoo. However,
setting gitweb is really easy. This document assumes you have your
public repositories in ``/var/git/``.

gitweb.cgi configuration
------------------------

In the directory where gitweb is installed you have to create at least
one file named ``index/index.aux``. This file defines the repositories
gitweb should show. The example below defines a project located in
``/var/git/test-project.git`` owned by ``Some Project Developer``.

  test-project.git Some+Project+Developer

( Note the use of the plus sign (``+``) )

Also you may want to create the file ``indextext.html``. This file will
be included in the header of the project listing page in gitweb.

Webserver configuration
-----------------------

If you use apache you may want to add the following to a ``.htaccess``
file in the directory where gitweb is installed.

  DirectoryIndex gitweb.cgi

In lighttpd you may want to add ``gitweb.cgi`` to your indexfiles in
your ``lighttpd.conf`` as follows:

server.indexfiles += ("gitweb.cgi")

.. vim: set tw=72 sw=4 et ft=glep : ..
