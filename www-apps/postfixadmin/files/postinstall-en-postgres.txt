Postfix Admin contains 3 views of administration:
  1. Site Admin view, located at http://${VHOST_HOSTNAME}${VHOST_APPDIR}/admin/.
  2. Domain Admin view, located at http://${VHOST_HOSTNAME}${VHOST_APPDIR}/.
  3. User Admin View, located at http://${VHOST_HOSTNAME}${VHOST_APPDIR}/users/.

In order to do the initial configuration you have to go to the Site Admin view.

The default password for the Site Admin view of Postfix Admin is admin/admin.

This is specified in the .htpasswd file in the /admin directory. Make sure
that the location of the .htpasswd file matches your path.
