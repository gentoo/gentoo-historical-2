Congratulations, you nearly finished installing the Kolab web client.

All you need to do in order to finish the setup of the groupware web
client is to enter the details of your Kolab server in the two files

  ${MY_INSTALLDIR}/config/kolab.php
  ${MY_INSTALLDIR}/kronolith/config/kolab.php

Just follow the comments in these files.

Once you are finished you should be able to log into the new site at

  http://${VHOST_HOSTNAME}/${VHOST_APPDIR}/

Enjoy!
