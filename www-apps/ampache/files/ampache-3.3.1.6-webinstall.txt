Installing Using the Web Interface:

As of 3.3-Beta3 Ampache includes an web based installation script. In order
for the script to work correctly you will need a user that has Database
create and modify rights for your mysql server. To use this script simply
visit /install.php. If you get a Access Denied make sure that your /config
directory does not contain an existing ampache.cfg

         Step 1 - Inserting the database, this requires you to enter
                 a username/pass for MySQL that is able to create
                 a brand new database and insert new tables. This does
                 not have to be the user you actually run ampache as
         Step 2 - Creating the Config file, this step asks for a 'user'
                 level account for MySQL that has full access over
                 the newly created ampache database, this can be the
                 same as the last step, but it is not recommended.
                 Ampache will attempt to write the config file directly
                 to the /config directory, if it isn't able to it
                 should prompt you to download the ampache.cfg simply
                 put it into /config and then visit the login page.
         Step 3 - Creating the Initial User Account, you will be asked
                 for a username and password for the administrator
                 account.
