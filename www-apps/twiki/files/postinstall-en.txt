You are almost done! 

1. Apache configs have been installed for you. You will need to restart
   Apache for them to take effect.

2. You may want to edit TWiki's config to suit your needs:
   ${MY_INSTALLDIR}/lib/TWiki.cfg

3. Run the testenv script from your browser:
   http://${VHOST_HOSTNAME}/${VHOST_APPDIR}/bin/testenv
   It will show you the user name of the CGI scripts, a table listing all CGI
   environment variables, and a test of your configuration file.

4. Read the install guide
   http://twiki.org/cgi-bin/view/TWiki/TWikiInstallationGuide
   particularly if you wish to set up email preferences or I18N.

5. Read ${MY_INSTALLDIR}/README.robustness for important security info.

6. Visit http://${VHOST_HOSTNAME}/twiki, or
   http://${VHOST_HOSTNAME}/${VHOST_APPDIR}/bin/view
