You are almost done!

1. ExecCGI needs to be enabled in your Moinmoin directory. You con do this by
simply
# echo "Options ExecCGI" > ${MY_INSTALLDIR}/.htaccess
# echo "AddHandler cgi-script .cgi" >> ${MY_INSTALLDIR}/.htaccess

2. Add the following lines to your Apache configs:
Alias /wiki "${MY_INSTALLDIR}"
ScriptAlias /mymoin "${MY_INSTALLDIR}/moin.cgi"

3. If you are running >=net-www/apache-2.0.52-r2, then you also need to turn
on .htaccess.  Look for the <Directory "/var/www/localhost/htdocs/"> stanza 
in httpd.conf, and change "AllowOverride None" to "AllowOverride All".

4. Restart Apache

5. Go to http://YOURHOST/mymoin

Enjoy!
