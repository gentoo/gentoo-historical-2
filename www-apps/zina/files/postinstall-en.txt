-----------------
  CONFIGURATION
-----------------

There is not much to do for Zina to work "out of the box" - just
browse to 

http://${VHOST_HOSTNAME}/${VHOST_APPDIR}

and follow the simple instructions. 

MAKE SURE TO CHANGE YOUR ADMIN PASSWORD!

-----------------
  SECURITY NOTE
-----------------

You are highly encouraged to restrict access to your Zina (unless you
actually WANT to have the world see your audio file collections). Zina
has no internal user-based authentication - only a single
administrative user and password.

-----------------
      NOTES
-----------------

This is the standalone Zina installation. For any embedded use, please
see "http://www.pancake.org/zina/" (Section "Installation").

You might also want to grab some sort of album cover fetching
application, like "AlbumArt" (in Portage as media-sound/albumart).
