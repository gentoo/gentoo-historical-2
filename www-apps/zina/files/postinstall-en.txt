NOTE: This is the standalone Zina. For any embedded use, please
see "http://www.pancake.org/zina/installation-0.11.x.html".

NOTE: To use the Zina web configuration interface, the file
"zina.ini.php" must be writable by the webserver user/group.
Or, you can paste the text given by Zina into the file by
hand, if you are into that sort of thing.

If your web server is running as user apache, you can use the
following command to ensure the file is writeable:

# chown apache\: ${MY_INSTALLDIR}/zina.ini.php

SECURITY NOTE: You are highly encouraged to restrict access to 
your Zina (unless you actually WANT to have the world see your
audio file collections). Zina has no internal user-based authentication
- only a single administrative user and password.

You might want to also grab some sort of album cover fetching
application, like "AlbumArt" (in Portage as media-sound/albumart).

Not much to do for Zina to work "out of the box" - just browse
to the location you've installed it into, and follow the
simple instructions. (MAKE SURE TO CHANGE YOUR ADMIN PASSWORD!)
