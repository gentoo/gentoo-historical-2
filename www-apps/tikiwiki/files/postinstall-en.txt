Setup Completion
---

If there is no existing TikiWiki install and database you will need to
create an empty database for TikiWiki before starting setup.  For
example (MySQL):

mysql -p -u root mysql <<__EOSQL
  CREATE DATABASE tiki;
  GRANT CREATE, DROP, INDEX, ALTER, SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
    ON tiki.*
    TO tikiuser@localhost
    IDENTIFIED BY 'a_good_password';
  FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
__EOSQL


TikiWiki likes to have a generous PHP environment.  Please edit
your php.ini or arrange the settings through another mechanism such as
Apache .htaccess files.

Tiki requires PHP to have :
    ==> 'memory_limit = 16M'
    ==> 'max_execution_time = 60'
Tiki likes PHP to have :
    ==> 'default_charset = utf-8'
    ==> 'file_uploads = On'

Make certain you have compiled php and mod_php with your database of choice in
the USE flags.

Please read the files in ${MY_INSTALLDIR}/doc
especially if you want clean URLs under Apache.

You may find further information on the Tiki website
    ==> http://tikiwiki.org/InstallGettingStarted

Note: The equivalent of running setup.sh has already been completed.


Now, point your browser to the location of tiki-install.php to complete the
setup/upgrade.  For example:

http://${VHOST_HOSTNAME}/tiki-install.php

You may need to manually rename tiki-install.php to tiki-install.done to
secure your system.

Enjoy your TikiWiki site.
