Setup Completion
---

If there is no existing TikiWiki install and database you will need to
create an empty database for TikiWiki before starting setup.  For
example (MySQL):

mysql -p -u root mysql <<__EOSQL
  CREATE DATABASE tiki;
  GRANT CREATE, DROP, INDEX, ALTER, SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
    ON tiki.*
    TO tikiuser@localhost
    IDENTIFIED BY 'a_good_password';
  FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
__EOSQL


TikiWiki likes to have a generous PHP environment.  Please edit
/etc/php4/php.ini or arrange the settings through another mechanism such as
Apache .htaccess files.

Tiki requires PHP to have :
    ==> 'memory_limit = 16M'
    ==> 'max_execution_time = 60'
Tiki likes PHP to have :
    ==> 'default_charset = utf-8'
    ==> 'file_uploads = On'


Please read the files in:
${G_HTDOCSDIR}${G_INSTALLDIR}doc 
especially if you want clean URLS under Apache.

You may find further information on the Tiki website
    ==> http://tikiwiki.org/InstallGettingStarted

Note: The equivalent of running setup.sh has already been completed.


Now, point your browser to the location of tiki-install.php to complete the
setup/upgrade.  For example:

http://${G_HOSTNAME}/${G_INSTALLDIR}/tiki-install.php


You may need to manually rename tiki-install.php to tiki-install.done to
secure your system.  For example:

cd ${G_HTDOCSDIR}${G_INSTALLDIR}
mv tiki-install.php tiki-install.done


Enjoy your TikiWiki site.
