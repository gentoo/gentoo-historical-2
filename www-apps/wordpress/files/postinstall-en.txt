INSTALLATION

Please make sure you have register_globals = off set in your

/etc/apache2/php.ini

file.

If this is not an option for your web server and you NEED it set to
on, then insert the following in your WordPress .htaccess file:

php_flag register_globals off

You will need to create a table for your WordPress database.  This
assumes you have some knowledge of MySQL, and already have it
installed and configured.  If not, please refer to the Gentoo MySQL
guide at the following URL:

http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/mysql-howto.xml 

Log in to MySQL, and create a new database called 'wordpress'. From
this point, you will need to edit your 

${MY_INSTALLDIR}/wp-config.php 

file.

Once this is done, you can log in to WordPress at

http://${VHOST_HOSTNAME}/${VHOST_APPDIR}

!!!!!!!!!                 SECURITY WARNING                   !!!!!!!!!!!

Wordpress has had a history of serious security flaws. Any application
with less widespread use but the same amount of security issues would
have been removed from the tree.

We decided to keep the application in the unstable portage tree so that
it get's some level of attention from our security team. Currently
you can expect us to react within 40 days of a reported security
problem.

This still means that you might open up your installation to hackers for
about a month after an issue has been made public. This is a severe
risk and you should keep a close eye on the common security trackers so
that you are able to fix problems with your installation yourself if
required.
