INSTALLATION

Please make sure you have register_globals = off set in your

/etc/apache2/php.ini

file.

If this is not an option for your web server and you NEED it set to
on, then insert the following in your WordPress .htaccess file:

php_flag register_globals off

You will need to create a table for your WordPress database.  This
assumes you have some knowledge of MySQL, and already have it
installed and configured.  If not, please refer to the Gentoo MySQL
guide at the following URL:

http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/mysql-howto.xml 

Log in to MySQL, and create a new database called 'wordpress'. From
this point, you will need to edit your 

${MY_INSTALLDIR}/wp-config.php 

file.

Once this is done, you can log in to WordPress at

http://${VHOST_HOSTNAME}/${VHOST_APPDIR}
