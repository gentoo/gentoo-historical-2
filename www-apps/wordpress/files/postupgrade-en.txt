!!!!!!!!!                 SECURITY WARNING                   !!!!!!!!!!!
                                                                     
Wordpress has had a history of serious security flaws. Any application
with less widespread use but the same amount of security issues would
have been removed from the tree.
                                                                     
After a short period of being in the unstable tree we once again decided
that we hard mask the package.

THIS MEANS THAT THERE IS NO GUARANTEE WHATSOEVER THAT THE PACKAGE WILL
GET UPGRADED WITHIN A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF TIME EVEN IN THE CASE OF
SEVERE SECURITY ISSUES.

We consider installing this package a severe risk to your system and 
you should keep a close eye on the common security trackers so
that you are able to fix problems with your installation yourself if
required.
