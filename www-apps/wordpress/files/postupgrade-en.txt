!!!!!!!!!                 SECURITY WARNING                   !!!!!!!!!!!
                                                                     
Wordpress has had a history of serious security flaws. Any application
with less widespread use but the same amount of security issues would
have been removed from the tree.
                                                                     
We decided to keep the application in the unstable portage tree so that
it get's some level of attention from our security team. Currently   
you can expect us to react within 40 days of a reported security 
problem.
                                                                     
This still means that you might open up your installation to hackers for
about a month after an issue has been made public. This is a severe  
risk and you should keep a close eye on the common security trackers so
that you are able to fix problems with your installation yourself if
required.
