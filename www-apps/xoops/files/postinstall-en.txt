0. Now create a database for Xoops to use (consult your MySQL manual if you
   don't know how).

1. You will need to
 chmod 666 ${MY_INSTALLDIR}/mainfile.php

2. Browse to http://${VHOST_HOSTNAME}/${VHOST_APPDIR}

3. When you are done with the installer:

 rm -rf ${MY_INSTALLDIR}/install
 chmod 444 ${MY_INSTALLDIR}/mainfile.php

Note that the extras have been installed into ${VHOST_ROOT}/${PN}-${PVR}
