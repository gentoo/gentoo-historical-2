NEW INSTALLS

0  Check to see if webapp-config automatically installed
   moodle for you in /var/www/localhost/htdocs. You should
   see a directory in there called moodle.  If it didn't
   install it manually:

	webapp-config -d moodle -I moodle 1.9.9

1  Edit the config.php file found at

	/var/www/localhost/htdocs/moodle/config.php

   You should probably change the database password,
   $CFG->dbpass = 'moodle_pass' to something more
   obscure.  Also, if your system has a FQDN, change
   the $CFG->wwwroot = 'http://localhost/moodle'
   to match the URL of your moodle installation.
   
   
   IF YOU ARE USING MYSQL,      do step 2a
   IF YOU ARE USING POSTGRESQL, do step 2b


2a Create a new mysql database and account with the
   appropriate privileges.  Make sure the username,
   password and database match their values in
   config.php from step 1.
   
   Connect to your mysql server using
   
	mysql -p -u root

   and at the mysql> prompt issue the following commands

	CREATE DATABASE moodle_db;
	GRANT ALL ON moodle_db.*
		TO moodle_user@localhost
		IDENTIFIED BY 'moodle_pass';
	flush privileges;

2b Issue the following commands at a shell, making sure
   the username, password and database match their values
   in config.php from step 1.

   su - postgres
   psql -c "create user moodle_user createdb;" template1
   psql -c "alter user moodle_user with encrypted password 'moodle_pass';" template1
   psql -c "create database moodle_db with encoding 'unicode';" -U moodle_user template1
   psql -c "alter user moodle_user nocreatedb;" template1
   su - root
   /etc/init.d/postgresql-8.4 reload

   NOTE: Moodle docs say that moodle only works with
   postgresql-7, but I've used it with 8 no problems.

3  Direct your browser to the URL in step 1.  You should see
   the license agreement.  Click "Yes" to continue.

4  You are now about to install.  Click the checkbox for
   "Unattended operation" and "Continue" to start.  Follow
   the wizard as you "Setup administrator account" and configure
   the "Front Page settings".

5  You now have a working installation.  Before putting it
   into production, you'll probably want to check that
   everything is sane.  In the "Site Administration" block,
   click on

   	Server -> Environment

   Make sure that you've got the green okay on all the
   Server Checks.  If you don't, click on the ? icons for
   popup help.

6  Add a cron-job to root's crontab.

   	su - root
	crontab -e  # fcrontab -e if you use fcron

   then add the line

	*/30 * * * *  root  php -q /var/www/localhost/htdocs/moodle/admin/cron.php  > /dev/null

   at the mysql> prompt issue the following commands:

	DROP DATABASE moodle_db;

ADDITIONAL PHP REQUIREMENTS

   Moodle allows for many method of authentication.  To see
   what these are, in the "Site Administration" block, click
   on

	Users -> Authentication -> Manage Authentication

   Moodle will try to authenticate by each method in order
   until it either succeeds or exhausts the list and fails.

   In order to use some of these methods, you need to make
   sure PHP was compiled with the correct support.  You will
   know that you do not have the correct support compiled in
   if authentication by all previous methods fails, and you
   encounter a method for which PHP does not have support.
   An error will be thrown and reported in the web page.
   
   Currently, the ebuild has support for the following

   	Auth Method		USE flag

	IMAP(S) or POP3(S)	imap
   	LDAP or CAS		ldap
	External database	odbc
	RADIUS			radius
