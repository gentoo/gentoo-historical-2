If you are using Apache, consider adding something like this to your
apache.conf:

ScriptAlias /viewcvs ${VHOST_CGIBINDIR}/${PN}/viewcvs.cgi
ScriptAlias /cvsquery ${VHOST_CGIBINDIR}/${PN}/cvsquery.cgi

Before using viewcvs, be sure to configure it properly.
Edit ${VHOST_ROOT}/${PN}/viewcvs.conf and ${VHOST_ROOT}/${PN}/cvsgraph.conf to
suit your needs.

If you're using mod_python, remember to add '-D PYTHON' in
/etc/conf.d/apache. The needed settings for viewcvs have been included in
${VHOST_ROOT}/htdocs/.htaccess.

If you're wanting to use the query engine, you'll need to first create a
database. Next, run the following command to populate the database with tables
you'll need.

# mysql -u root -p <database name> < /usr/share/webapps/viewcvs/${PV}/sqlscripts/mysql/${PV}_create.sql

After this, please read the upstream documentation on how to setup the query
engine. This can be located at /usr/share/docs/${P}/INSTALL.gz.
