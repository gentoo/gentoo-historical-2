If you are using Apache, consider adding something like this to your
apache.conf:

ScriptAlias /viewcvs /var/www/localhost/cgi-bin/viewcvs/viewcvs.cgi
ScriptAlias /cvsquery /var/www/localhost/cgi-bin/viewcvs/cvsquery.cgi

Before using viewcvs, be sure to configure it properly. 
Edit ${VHOST_ROOT}/${PN}/viewcvs.conf and ${VHOST_ROOT}/${PN}/cvsgraph.conf to
suit your needs. Consult the two .dist files for a start.
