If you are using Apache, consider adding something like this to your
apache.conf:

ScriptAlias /viewcvs ${VHOST_CGIBINDIR}/${PN}/viewcvs.cgi
ScriptAlias /cvsquery ${VHOST_CGIBINDIR}/${PN}/cvsquery.cgi

Before using viewcvs, be sure to configure it properly.
Edit ${VHOST_ROOT}/${PN}/viewcvs.conf and ${VHOST_ROOT}/${PN}/cvsgraph.conf to
suit your needs.
