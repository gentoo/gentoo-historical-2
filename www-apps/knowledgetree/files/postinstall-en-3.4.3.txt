INSTALLATION

The ebuild installs most parts of knowledgeTree automatically, but 
you will have to create a database for the document management system.

You can do this using the following commands as the mysql root user:

> mysql -u root -p <<EOF
  CREATE DATABASE dms;
  GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON dms.* TO 'dms'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'djw9281js';
  FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
EOF

> mysql -u root -p <<EOF 
  GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON dms.* TO 'dmsadmin'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'js9281djw';
  FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
EOF

Please do not forget to choose a different password than
'js9281djw'. This is just the standard password stored as a default in
${MY_INSTALLDIR}/config/config.ini.

Now as user "dmsadmin":

> mysql -u dmsadmin -pjs9281djw dms < ${MY_HTDOCSDIR}/sql/mysql/install/structure.sql
> mysql -u dmsadmin -pjs9281djw dms < ${MY_HTDOCSDIR}/sql/mysql/install/data.sql

Now you need to set the MySQL passwords for the dms and dmsadmin user
in the ${MY_INSTALLDIR}/config/config.ini file so that knowledgeTree
can access the database.

Finally you can go to http://${VHOST_HOSTNAME}/${VHOST_APPDIR} and log in
as user "admin" with the password "admin".

!!! PHP4 !!!

This is a php4 application. Do not try to run it under php5. It will fail!

POSTGRES

You can also use knowledgtree with postgres. This ebuild currently
does not provide support for it but if there is a need for it, please
submit a feature request to the gentoo buzilla system.
