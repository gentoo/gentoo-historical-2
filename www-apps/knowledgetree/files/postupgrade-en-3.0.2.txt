UPGRADE

If you are upgrading from knowledgetree-2.* and had customizations in
your environment.php you will need to transfer these to the new
config.ini which now holds all configuration values.

YOU ARE ADVISED TO BACKUP YOUR OLD DATABASE BEFORE UPGRADING!!! 

Now go to http://${VHOST_HOSTNAME}/${VHOST_APPDIR}/setup/upgrade.php 
and press the "upgrade" button.

!!! PHP4 !!!

This is still a php4 application. Do not try to run it under php5. It
will fail!
