*freenet-20020214.ebuild ( 18 Feb 2002 )

  18 Feb 2002; Karl Trygve Kalleberg <karltk@gentoo.org> ChangeLog files/digest-freenet-20020214 files/freenet files/update-freenet:

  Freenet is a large-scale peer-to-peer network which pools the power of 
  member computers around the world to create a massive virtual information 
  store open to anyone to freely publish or view information of all kinds. 
  Freenet is:

    * Highly survivable: All internal processes are completely anonymized and 
      decentralized across the global network, making it virtually impossible 
      for an attacker to destroy information or take control of the system.
    * Private: Freenet makes it extremely difficult for anyone to spy on the 
      information that you are viewing, publishing, or storing.
    * Secure: Information stored in Freenet is protected by strong 
      cryptography against malicious tampering or counterfeiting.
    * Efficient: Freenet dynamically replicates and relocates information in 
      response to demand to provide efficient service and minimal bandwidth 
      usage regardless of load. Significantly, Freenet generally requires 
      log(n) time to retrieve a piece of information in a network of size n.
