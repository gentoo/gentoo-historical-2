  DCTC is a Direct Connect clone, a windoz client allowing users to
  share their files and talk (like IRC but more software sharing
  oriented) using a proprietary protocol. DCTC stands for Direct
  Connect Text Client. DCTC is release under GPL however, if you use
  it regularly and want to support its development, you can send a
  small fee.
