*frostwire-4.13.5 (25 Mar 2008)

  25 Mar 2008; William L. Thomson Jr. <wltjr@gentoo.org> +metadata.xml,
  +frostwire-4.13.5.ebuild:
  Initial ebuild for Frostwire, fork of Limewire. Based on ebuild from
  java-experimental overlay and limewire ebuilds. It's buggy and still needs
  work. Adding to tree for exposure and to mirror sources for upstream.
