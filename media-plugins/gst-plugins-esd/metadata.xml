	GStreamer plugin for outputting sound to ESound Daemon.

	This element outputs sound to an already-running Enlightened Sound Daemon
	(ESound Daemon, esd). Note that a sound daemon will never be auto-spawned
	through this element (regardless of the system configuration), since this
	is actively prevented by the element. If you must use esd, you need to
	make sure it is started automatically with your session or otherwise.

	You probably want to use a different sound output plugin, as esound is
	deprecated. For example gst-plugins-pulse if using a PulseAudio enabled
	desktop, or gst-plugins-alsa.
