*blop-0.2.5 (26 Jan 2003)

  26 Jan 2003; Tobias Eichert <viz@gentoo.org> blop-0.2.5.ebuild
  files/digest-blop-0.2.5 ChangeLog:

  New package for LADSPA sound effects plugins. Submitted by 
  rigo@home.nl (Rigo Ketelings) (bug #9456) but this package is
  taken from bug #12830, a modified version by ashura666@mac.com
  which is more standards compliant. Did a few ebuild
  cleanups to make it real standards compliant. ;)
