  28 Jan 2003; Hannes Mehnert <hannes@gentoo.org> xmms-arts-0.4-r6.ebuild:
  removed gentoo-endian.patch, xmms-arts doesn't work on !x86 (according
  to KEYWORDS), this closes bug #11604.

  24 Nov 2002; Mark Guertin <gerk@gentoo.org> xmms-arts-0.4-r6.ebuild:
  marked as -ppc.  Outputs nothing but static, seems like endianess
  issues.  Will submit bug upstream.
