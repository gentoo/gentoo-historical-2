I just found another semi-critical bug, whose fix should really get
into 0.91.

It turns out that "grub-install" doesn't have any "sync" calls to make
sure any filesystem caches are coherent with the raw devices they are
on top of...  so if your filesystem waits to write out any data from the
copy command in the script to put the "stage1" and "stage2" in their
final location, you're hosed.

I found this because it just bit me on one of my systems running stock
RedHat 7.2 with a large "stage2".

The only script that is patched here is "grub-install".  The others
don't appear to need it as they either unmount things first or don't
refer to devices.

Hmm.  Maybe the right fix is to make the "sync" system call when
starting the GRUB shell with a device map that refers to any real disks
or something like that.
