*gentoo-sources-2.4.19-r10 (06 Oct 2002)

  06 Oct 2002; Brandon Low <lostlogic@gentoo.org> gentoo-sources-2.4.19-r10.ebuild:

  While testing this kerenl I ran into very bad crashing behavior with 
  the USE="acpi4linux" option enabled... just a warning.  But for you
  laptopers it is still there.

  Well I dug up about 3-4 hours of time and merged xfs into this kernel
  so everyone who has been asking for it finally gets their way because
  I hate being unpopular.  I hope you all enjoy XFS, it is enabled by a
  hidden useflag so set USE="xfs" to turn it on for this kernel.  Please
  let me know your results.

  New in this release:
  - Dropped ext3-htree due to corruption with current e2fsprogs
    this may bite some of you who are already using it, but
    hopefully it will be updated before you need to fsck your
    partitions a lot.
  - Update EVMS
  - Update JFS
  - Fix for grsecurity compilation
  - Update patches.txt documentation and kernel.eclass (makes older
    a little funky, but is more forward working)
  - Fix processor type options to show gcc>31 rather than gcc31
  - Add futexes support
  - Add imon support
  - Optional XFS patch just set USE="xfs"
  - Optional ACPI patch just set USE="acpi4linux"
  - Redone ebuild setup now we have an eclass for these things
  - Rename some patches to better names for use with KERNEL_EXCLUDE
  - Add support for KERNEL_EXCLUDE
  - Add and re-arrange VIA bugfixes
  - Update grsecurity
  - Switch to latest release IPSEC Free S/WAN
  - Add usbdnet support for Zaurus handhelds
  - Updated preempt
  - Updated rmap
  - Add xattr and acl patches and include the JFS patches for them.
  - Add supermount patches.
  - Incorportate the small fixes done to gentoo-sources-2.4.19-r9

*gentoo-sources-2.4.19-r9 (03 Sep 2002)

  Add 2 line patch to fix compilation with HIGHMEM

  03 Sep 2002; Brandon Low <lostlogic@gentoo.org> gentoo-sources-2.4.19-r9.ebuild:

  Whole new kernel patching methodology and new kernel.  

  I won't mark what has changed as that would be impossible,
  instead read /usr/share/doc/gentoo-sources-2.4.19-r9/patches.txt.gz
  for information about all the patches in this kernel.
