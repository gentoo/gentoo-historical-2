*ac-sources-2.4.20_rc1-r3 (14 Nov 2002)

  14 Nov 2002; Brandon Low <lostlogic@gentoo.org> ac-sources-2.4.20_rc1-r3.ebuild:

  Change versioning, this will be easier to bump now.  Oh and bump to latest.

*ac-sources-2.4.20_pre83 (06 Oct 2002)

  06 Oct 2002; Brandon Low <lostlogic@gentoo.org> ac-sources-2.4.20_pre83.ebuild:

  New package for -ac sources, the versioning is silly
  because we really have 2 parts to the -pre number the
  marcelo kernel pre version and the -ac subversion so 
  _pre83 means -pre8-ac3.  This doesn't hold up if
  there are more than 10 -ac versions for a -pre I hope
  that -ac never sinks to that level ;-).
