RH_DISTRO_VER="8.0"

# The easiest way to grab Red Hat kernel sources is from the rpm file
# itself.  We used to generate a patch against vanilla sources trees but
# the added dependency of rpm2targz is minimal compared with having to
# generate a new diff for every minor version update.  (Also not to many
# people have 2.4.18 vanilla source tarballs floating around these days)
