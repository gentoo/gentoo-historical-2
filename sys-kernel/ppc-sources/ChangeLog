*ppc-sources-2.4.19-r3 <kain@kain.org> :

  Second official ppc kernel release:

  More drivers in the defconfig for the cdrom image have been integrated;
  We also have the drm-kernel from the ati.2 drivers at gatos.sf.net integrated
  in.  These work better on the TiBook rev2 (I don't know about rev3).

  Fixes also in the ebuild
