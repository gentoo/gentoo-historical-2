*ppc-sources-2.4.19-r6 (12 Jun 2002)

  12 Jun 2002; Kain <kain@kain.org> all :

  We are back to a standard kernel + XFS.  This will be the ppc-sources used
  for the gentoo-ppc-1.2 bootcd.

*ppc-sources-2.4.19-r5 (26 May 2002)

  26 May 2002; Kain <kain@kain.org> all :

  Firewire still works, but otherwise this kernel is more like -r3.
  The rmap vm doesn't seem to work too well on ppc after additional testing.

*ppc-sources-2.4.19-r4 (26 May 2002)

  26 May 2002; Kain <kain@kain.org> all :

  Firewire works again.  This kernel implements the O(1) scheduler, XFS,
  the rmap VM, and the HZ=1000 timer.

*ppc-sources-2.4.19-r3 <kain@kain.org> :

  Second official ppc kernel release:

  More drivers in the defconfig for the cdrom image have been integrated;
  We also have the drm-kernel from the ati.2 drivers at gatos.sf.net integrated
  in.  These work better on the TiBook rev2 (I don't know about rev3).

  Fixes also in the ebuild

*ppc-sources-2.4.19 <pvdabeel@gentoo.org> :

  First official ppc kernel release
