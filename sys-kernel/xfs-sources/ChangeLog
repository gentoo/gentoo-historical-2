*xfs-sources-2.4.19-r2 (06 Oct 2002)

  06 Oct 2002; Brandon Low <lostlogic@gentoo.org> xfs-sources-2.4.19-r1.ebuild:

  This release is a team effort of Tobias Eichert <tobias@databoogie.net>
  and myself.

  While testing this kerenl I ran into very bad crashing behavior with
  the USE="acpi4linux" option enabled... just a warning.  But for you
  laptopers it is still there.

  New from xfs-sources-2.4.19-r1:
  - Update to latest XFS patch
  - Dropped ext3-htree due to corruption with current e2fsprogs
    this may bite some of you who are already using it, but
    hopefully it will be updated before you need to fsck your
    partitions a lot.
  - Update EVMS
  - Update JFS
  - Fix for grsecurity compilation
  - Update patches.txt documentation and kernel.eclass (makes older
    a little funky, but is more forward working)
  - Fix processor type options to show gcc>31 rather than gcc31
  - Add futexes support
  - Add imon support
  - Optional ACPI patch just set USE="acpi4linux"
  - Redone ebuild setup now we have an eclass for these things
  - Rename some patches to better names for use with KERNEL_EXCLUDE
  - Add support for KERNEL_EXCLUDE
  - Add and re-arrange VIA bugfixes
  - Update grsecurity
  - Switch to latest release IPSEC Free S/WAN
  - Add usbdnet support for Zaurus handhelds
  - Add supermount patches.
  - Incorportate the small fixes done to xfs-sources-2.4.19-r1
