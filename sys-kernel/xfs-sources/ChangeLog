  6 Jan 2003; Tobias Eichert <viz@gentoo.org> xfs-sources-2.4.20_pre3.ebuild:

  New Version.

  Thanks to sethbc <sethbc@gentoo.org> who helped me getting along with
  a cryptoloop issue. If Loop IV hack is enabled it causes
  the compilation to break with an error; changing that to a #warning
  will fix it. More information on that in the docs file.

  - Add supermount support.
  - Add usbdnet support.
  - Add futexes support.
  - Add I2C support (recent patch for lm-sensors).

  - Add ECC support.
  - Add v4l2 (Video for Linux 2) support.
  - Add SuperFreeS/WAN Support.
  
  Enjoy and test :)

  New version.

  Since my first version broke some stuff I made a new
  one containing minor bugfixes. Now it should compile
  all the way through..

  New from xfs-sources-2.4.20_pre1:

  - Update imon to recent version.
  - Removed openwall for further testing.
  - I tried several configs this time ;)

  Please test and send bugreports.
  
*xfs-sources-2.4.20_pre1 (22 Dec 2002)

  22 Dec 2002; Tobias Eichert <viz@gentoo.org> xfs-sources-2.4.20_pre1.ebuild:

  Version bump.
  
  This is the first xfs-sources release I did by myself;
  it aims for having a lot of nice and stable features
  in the near future. Please test it and report bugs
  since it's going to become the next Live CD kernel.
  
  Features:
  
  - Update 3.5 GB address space patch.
  - Update to latest XFS (full features).
  - Update ACPI snapshot (12 Dec 2002).
  - Update EVMS.
  - Add Win4Lin (including the mki-adapter patch).
  - Add dc395x (Driver for older Tekram SCSI host adapters, fixes bug #12218).
  - Add imon support (SGI's Inode Monitor).
  - Update patch-int (aka CryptoAPI).
  - Update loop-jari (for encrypted loopback devices).
  - Add openwall (security related things 
    like non-executable user stack area,etc.).
  - Miscellaneous little patches.

  
  17 Dec 2002; Brandon Low <lostlogic@gentoo.org>:
  Make all kernel-sources SLOT="${KV}"

  06 Oct 2002; Brandon Low <lostlogic@gentoo.org> xfs-sources-2.4.19-r1.ebuild:

  This release is a team effort of Tobias Eichert <tobias@databoogie.net>
  and myself.

  While testing this kerenl I ran into very bad crashing behavior with
  the USE="acpi4linux" option enabled... just a warning.  But for you
  laptopers it is still there.

  New from xfs-sources-2.4.19-r1:
  - Update to latest XFS patch.
  - Dropped ext3-htree due to corruption with current e2fsprogs
    this may bite some of you who are already using it, but
    hopefully it will be updated before you need to fsck your
    partitions a lot.
  - Update EVMS.
  - Update JFS.
  - Fix for grsecurity compilation.
  - Update patches.txt documentation and kernel.eclass (makes older
    a little funky, but is more forward working).
  - Fix processor type options to show gcc>31 rather than gcc31
  - Add futexes support.
  - Add imon support.
  - Optional ACPI patch just set USE="acpi4linux".
  - Redone ebuild setup now we have an eclass for these things.
  - Rename some patches to better names for use with KERNEL_EXCLUDE.
  - Add support for KERNEL_EXCLUDE.
  - Add and re-arrange VIA bugfixes.
  - Update grsecurity.
  - Switch to latest release IPSEC Free S/WAN.
  - Add usbdnet support for Zaurus handhelds.
  - Add supermount patches.
  - Incorportate the small fixes done to xfs-sources-2.4.19-r1.
