  New 2.4.22 based hardened-sources thanks to
  Phil West <p.west@computer.org>.
  
  These sources include:
  	- New SELinux API
  	- Updated CK-base
  	- Updated GRSec
  	- Systrace
  	- SuperFreeS/WAN 1.99.8
  	- Propolice kernel build support
  	- EVMS
  	- Other various security related patches

  14 Sep 2003; Matthew Rickard <frogger@gentoo.org> hardened-sources-2.4.21.ebuild:
  Updated hardened-sources based on the 2.4.21 Linux kernel.
  This includes updates to most major components such as:
    - ck-base-0306300059
    - selinux-2.4-2003071106
    - grsecurity-2.0-rc1
    - Updated IPTables patch-o-matic

  16 Jun 2003; Matthew Rickard <frogger@gentoo.org> :
  Initial import of hardened-sources-2.4.20-r4.  This revision
  includes only a few changes, but one of these is an important
  security fix.  It is recommended all users of hardened-sources
  upgrade to this release.

  	- ioperm bug fix
  	- fixed compilation failure when building without GRSec

  SAL (Secure Auditing for Linux) is NOT included in this revision
  due to time constraints, but is planned for inclusion in the near
  future.
