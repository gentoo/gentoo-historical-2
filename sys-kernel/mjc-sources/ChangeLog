  Make all kernel-sources SLOT="${KV}"

  14 Dec 2002; Michael J. Cohen <mjc@gentoo.org>
  removed mjc-sources-2.4.20-r1.ebuild, too many problems...

*mjc-sources-2.4.20-r1 (30 Nov 2002)
  30 Nov 2002; Seth Chandler <sethbc@gentoo.org> mjc-sources-2.4.20-r1.ebuild

  28 Oct 2002; Brandon Low <lostlogic@gentoo.org> lolo-sources-2.4.20_pre10-r2.ebuild:

  Enjoy, version bump from MJC

*mjc-sources-2.4.20_pre10-r1 (25 Oct 2002)

  25 Oct 2002; Brandon Low <lostlogic@gentoo.org> lolo-sources-2.4.20_pre10-r1.ebuild:

  I know the version is wrong, but this is more correct to how he names
  them.

  This kernel is very nice, has no documentation, but I'm running it...

  Rather than lolo-sources, this may become the next gentoo-sources as
  it matches very closely what I'm doing with lolo-sources, but MJC
  seems to be doing a better job keeping up with stuff ATM.

*mjc-sources-2.4.20-r2 (30 Sep 2002)

  30 Sep 2002; Brandon Low <lostlogic@gentoo.org> lolo-sources-2.4.20-r1.ebuild:

  Re-added mjc-sources, enjoy.
