This ebuild has installed the sources for the Linux kernel shipped with the
latest version of Red Hat Linux Alpha, maintained by Compaq.

Compaq lag behind releases from kernel.org, but their kernels are
extensively tested, and used by many thousands. This kernel will include
bugfixes and extended hardware support, and is probably the most widely
used Linux kernel on the Alpha Platform today.
