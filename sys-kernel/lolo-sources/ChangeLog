*lolo-sources-2.4.19.10_pre6 (03 Oct 2002)

  03 Oct 2002; Brandon Low <lostlogic@gentoo.org> lolo-sources-2.4.19.10_pre6.ebuild:

  Ok so I lied, here is another pre.

  New in this release:
  - Update EVMS
  - Update JFS
  - Fix for unresolved symbols due to lack of grsecurity ifdefs

  Before -r10:
  - Test Test Test
  - Defconfig
  - Check out Trance's pcmcia problems

*lolo-sources-2.4.19.10_pre5 (01 Oct 2002)

  01 Oct 2002; Brandon Low <lostlogic@gentoo.org> lolo-sources-2.4.19.10_pre5.ebuild:

  Ok, this is the last pre... call it an rc, nothing else changing before
  -r10 because it is time to start on a new series for 2.4.20.

  New in this release:
  - Fix for grsecurity compilation
  - Fix for supermount from -jp
  - Update patches.txt documentation and kernel.eclass (makes older
    a little funky, but is more forward working)
  - Fix lvcool to be available when it should
  - Fix processor type options to show gcc>31 rather than gcc31

  Before -r10:
  - Test Test Test
  - defconfig

*lolo-sources-2.4.19.10_pre4 (24 Sep 2002)

  24 Sep 2002; Brandon Low <lostlogic@gentoo.org> lolo-sources-2.4.19.10_pre4.ebuild:

  While testing this kerenl I ran into very bad crashing behavior with 
  the USE="acpi4linux" option enabled... just a warning.  But for you
  laptopers it is still there.

  Well I dug up about 3-4 hours of time and merged xfs into this kernel
  so everyone who has been asking for it finally gets their way because
  I hate being unpopular.  I hope you all enjoy XFS, it is enabled by a
  hidden useflag so set USE="xfs" to turn it on for this kernel.  Please
  let me know your results.

*lolo-sources-2.4.19.10_pre3 (21 Sep 2002)

  21 Sep 2002; Brandon Low <lostlogic@gentoo.org> lolo-sources-2.4.19.10_pre3.ebuild:

  New this version:
  - Add futexes support
  - Add imon support
  - Optional ACPI patch just set USE="acpi4linux"
  - Redone ebuild setup now we have an eclass for these things
  - Add support for KERNEL_EXCLUDE
  - Rename some patches to better names for use with KERNEL_EXCLUDE

  Coming before gentoo-sources-2.4.19-r10:
  - Documentation documentation documentation
  - Testing Testing Testing Testing Testing

*lolo-sources-2.4.19.10_pre2 (21 Sep 2002)

  21 Sep 2002; Brandon Low <lostlogic@gentoo.org> lolo-sources-2.4.19.10_pre2.ebuild:

  Due to difficulties in getting updates, we had to drop the planned
  fixes for amd74xx (amd760mpx), hpt366 (hpt370+), and radeonfb...

  I also haven't been having luck finding fixes for sim710.c or i810_dma.c

  However, I think that the other things that have gone into this kernel
  warrant it's release as -r10 with only the additional work noted below.

  New this version:
  - Add and re-arrange VIA bugfixes
  - LVcool AMD Athlon/Duron Cooling
  - Update grsecurity
  - Switch to latest release IPSEC Free S/WAN
  - Add usbdnet support for Zaurus handhelds
  - Change versioning again, now I can use a consistant method to create
    versions for all the kernels that I do the ebuilds for.  This kernel
    is now 2.4.19-lolo-r10_pre2

  Coming before gentoo-sources-2.4.19-r10:
  - Add a method for users to turn off patches with a shell var
  - updated defconfig patch with better defaults for i386
  - updated and improved patches.txt documentation
  - incorporate ACPI from acpi.sourceforge.net (this is now debatible,
    mjc says that it can still physically break machines, this may
    become an optional patch maybe I'll do the merge and leave it to
    users to use it if they want to.)

*lolo-sources-2.4.19.10_pre1 (19 Sep 2002)

  19 Sep 2002; Brandon Low <lostlogic@gentoo.org> lolo-sources-2.4.19.10_pre1.ebuild:

  Fix kernel version to not confuse mozilla any more, this kernel's
  designation is officially linux-2.4.19-r10-lolo_pre1, and no I don't
  care if you hate my naming scheme... it clearly attaches my 
  pre-release kernels to their appropriate gentoo-sources releases, etc.

  Updated all patches with known updates to their latest
  (JFS, preempt, rmap, nfs, nfs-over-tcp)

  Add xattr and acl patches and include the JFS patches for them.

  Add supermount patches.

  Incorportate the small fixes done to gentoo-sources-2.4.19-r9 into
  the main patchball.

  Coming before gentoo-sources-2.4.19-r10:
  - updated grsecurity, pending upstream release
  - updated defconfig patch with better defaults for i386
  - updated and improved patches.txt documentation
  - backports for AMD74xx, radeonfb, and HPT366 driverd from -ac
    done by Michael Cohen <mjc@gentoo.org>
  - incorporate ACPI from acpi.sourceforge.net
  - Possibly other, depending on stability, timing, and how much I get
    harrassed about things :)
  - Fix compilation issues with sim710 and i810dma (I hope)
  - Change up which VIA bugfixes we use
  - Lvcool by Cardoe

*lolo-sources-2.4.19.9_rc2 (02 Sep 2002)

  02 Sep 2002; Brandon Low <lostlogic@gentoo.org> lolo-sources-2.4.19.9_rc2.ebuild:

  Removed lock-break, contains known races against 2.4.19.

  Fix grsecurity/Config.in for badness.

  Add some things from iptables-patch-o-matic thanks to Azarah.

  Put back missing IDE Taskfile IO option in config.

*lolo-sources-2.4.19.9_rc1 (01 Sep 2002)

  01 Sep 2002; Brandon Low <lostlogic@gentoo.org> lolo-sources-2.4.19.9_rc1.ebuild:

  Thanks to Doug Goldstein <cardoe@gentoo.org> for all his testing to pin down
  a problem in the lvcool patch and then fixing it.  (even though the patch
  didn't end up in this kernel)

*lolo-sources-2.4.19.9_pre2 (01 Sep 2002)

  01 Sep 2002; Brandon Low <lostlogic@gentoo.org> lolo-sources-2.4.19.9_pre2.ebuild:

  Added default config patch, fixed alsa-driver compilation against this kernel, 
  fixed version setting issues with the ebuild (with any luck).

*lolo-sources-2.4.19.9_pre1 (01 Sep 2002)

  01 Sep 2002; Brandon Low <lostlogic@gentoo.org> lolo-sources-2.4.19.9_pre1.ebuild:

  First release of the lolo-sources, please test these and let me know what you get.
