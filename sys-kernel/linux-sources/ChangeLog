*linux-sources-2.4.17-r5 (20 Mar 2002)
*linux-sources-2.4.18 (20 Mar 2002)

  20 Mar 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org>: We now do a "yes "" | make
  oldconfig" for linux-headers (in src_compile()) in order to ensure that
  /usr/include/linux/autoconf.h gets merged, which is required for things such
  as iptables and likely many other packages.  No rev bump.

*linux-sources-2.4.17-r5 (12 Mar 2002)
*linux-sources-2.4.18 (12 Mar 2002)

  12 Mar 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org>: Reworked internals of
  2.4.17-r5 and 2.4.18 ebuilds but did not bump version since the actual kernel
  sources are the same.  A lot of streamlining.  In addition, we now use the
  existing .config of the currently-active (pointed to by /usr/src/linux)
  kernel if available.  Many things were moved to pkg_postinst() as they fit
  better there.  We now do a "make dep" after the kernel sources are installed.
  This closes bug #1045, which will cause any kernel module-related ebuild
  merges to fail if linux-sources has been updated without the user doing a
  manual "make dep".

*linux-sources-2.2.x (28 Feb 2002)

  28 Feb 2002; Grant Goodyear <g2boojum@gentoo.org>:
  New 2.2 sources; read ebuilds for comments.  Note: Masked until the
  necessary sys-apps/baselayout changes become available.  

*linux-sources-2.4.17-r5 (14 Feb 2002)

  14 Feb 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org>:
  acpi-20020214-2.4.17.diff.gz added back since they closed bug #689 for us;
  ide-2.4.17.02072002.patch has been removed due to bug #690 and will be added
  back when this bug is closed (The existence of this bug has been confirmed
  with the patch author)

*linux-sources-2.4.17-r4 (13 Feb 2002)

  13 Feb 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org>: XFS was updated from "26
  Jan 2002" to "13 Feb 2002"; IDE patch updated from "01192002" to "02072002";
  RML preempt patch was updated from 2.4.17-1 to 2.4.17-3; irqrate-a1 was
  removed (closing bug #396 and possibly others); acpi-20020208-2.4.17 was
  added but then removed.  It conflicts with stock aic7xxx SCSI driver and a
  bunch of other stuff; bug report sent "upstream" to their bug tracker at
  http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/acpi and also recorded in our bug tracker
  at http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=689.  We will add this patch back
  once these various issues have been resolved.

*linux-sources-2.4.17-r3 (1 Feb 2002)

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
  
  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
