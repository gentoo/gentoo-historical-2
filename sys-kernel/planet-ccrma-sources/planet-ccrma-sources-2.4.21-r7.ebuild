# This package contains the Linux Kernel source for the version of the
# RedHat Linux Kernel modified by the Planet CCRMA project.
#
# Do not report problems with this source package or the resulting compiled
# compiled kernel to Red Hat, Inc.  Red Hat is not responsible for this
# package and has offered no warranties or promises that the kernels
# resulting from the compilation of this package will work on anything
# except specific versions of the Red Hat distribution and specific
# compiler revisions.
#
# Gentoo provides this package without any guarantees that this kernel
# will compile and run correctly and will only respond to bug reports
# dealing with Gentoo specific packaging problems.

# The easiest way to grab Red Hat kernel sources is from the rpm file
# itself.  We used to generate a patch against vanilla sources trees but
# the added dependency of rpm2targz is minimal compared with having to
# generate a new diff for every minor version update.  (Also not to many
# people have 2.4.18 vanilla source tarballs floating around these days)
