*wolk-sources-4.0s-rc4

  24 March 2003; Bob Johnson <livewire@gentoo.org>:

	Changelog from v4.0s-rc3 -> v4.0s-rc4
	-     "reallyquiet" boot option to shut up all console log level output
	-     This is important!
               		Use a sched_yield that scales well by default, this should
               		help with JVM or applications with huge lock contention in 
               		the current libpthread, but it will hurt interactivity
              	 	of those apps if there's some background load. For OpenOffice
              	       and/or KDE set the sysctl back to 0, you don't mind if
              	   	sched_yield doesn't allow the colliding-workloads to scale
        	       well. The scale-behaviour is also the preferred one for all
        	       sched_yield usages in the kernel. Over time nothing should call
       	       	       sched_yield() anymore, this is an hack for now.
	-     "local users can obtain full privileges" exploit (CAN-2003-0127)
	-      some rmap VM merge errors in v4.0s-pre releases
	-      annoying bug where opening a new xterm/aterm/$whatever term will
        	      pause a video playing for a second
	-      annoying bug where calling "mailq from sendmail" will also pause
        	      a video playing for a second
	-      Error out for the case of a gcc-2.96 compiler with
	              CONFIG_FRAME_POINTER set. It generates seriously incorrect code.
	-      missing cli() in isdn_net.c
	-      procfs memory leak
	-      e100 network driver memory leak
	-      Aironet 4500 Pcmcia driver memory leak
	-      drivers/usb/hub.c memory leak
	-      emu10k1 memory leak
	-      Internet PhoneJACK driver memory leak
	-      Windows Logical Disk Manager partition handler memory leak
	-      Specialix SX series cards driver memory leak
	-      ircomm_core memory leak
	-      i2o_core.c memory leak
	-      dpt_i2o.c fix for possibly memory corruption on reset timeout
	-      Essential RoadRunner HIPPI board driver memory leak
	-      drivers/scsi/cpqfcTSinit.c memory leak
	-      802.1q vlan proc memory leak
	-      IBM Hot Plug Controller Driver multiple memory leaks
	-      UFS memory leak
	-      rd_load_image() memory leak
	-      bh_kmap_irq() breaks IDE with Preempt
	-      another potential deadlock in ll_rw_block
	-      gcc >= v3.3.1 inlining bugs
	-      Toshiba keyboard sometimes send a key twice
	-      reiserfs: Make balloc[] tails[] and hash[] in super.c static
	-      reiserfs: gcc v3.3 compile fix
	-      JFS: collision with blk-atomic
	-      Ext2/3: noatime ignored for newly created inodes
	-      anti-deadlock for the o1 scheduler that can otherwise send
	              a cross IPI with irq disabled.
	-      ACPI v2003-03-21
	-      Systrace v1.1
	-      rmap VM v15e
                	- make reclaiming unused inodes more efficient
                	- fix DRM memory leak
                	- fix potential infinite loop in kswapd
                	- clean up elevator.h (no IO scheduler in -rmap...)
                	- page aging interval tuned on a per zone basis, better
        	          wakeup mechanism for sudden memory pressure
	-      CPU Frequency scaling v2.4.20-9
	-      XFS v1.2-cvs as of 2003-03-19
	-      kdb v4.0
	-      Super FreeS/WAN v1.99.6 Final
	-      grsecurity v1.99e Final
	-      New Adaptec AIC7xxx/AIC79xx drivers v2003-03-18
	-      ext3 htree code for 2.4.21-pre5 2nd update
	-      Orlov ext2/ext3 block allocator code for 2.4.21-pre5 2nd update
	-      from latest -AA: aio-18
	-      from latest -AA: kgdb-7
	-      Bonding v2.4.20-20030207
	-      ALSA v0.9.0-rc4: because no one makes 0.9.1 Final patch, so ...
	-      LowLatency: because after some extensive benchmarking I saw that
        	      it is slower than the lowlatency fixes in -AA. LowLatency has
        	      also a deadlock possibility for SMP machines, the fixes not!
	-      remove  inode-highmem-2: because rmap has better/faster code now
	-      removed iput_free(): because rmap has better/faster code now
	-      replaced:LowLatency in favor of lowlatency fixes from latest -AA
