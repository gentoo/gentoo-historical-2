HTML-TEMPLATE is a portable library for Common Lisp which can be used
to fill templates with arbitrary (string) values at
runtime. (Actually, it doesn't matter whether the result is HTML. It's
just very likely that this will be what the library is mostly used
for.)  It is loosely modeled after the Perl module HTML::Template and
compatible with a subset of its syntax, i.e. it should be possible to
use your HTML-TEMPLATE templates with HTML::Template as well (but
usually not the other way around).
