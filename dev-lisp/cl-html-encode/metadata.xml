HTML-ENCODE is a small Common Lisp library for encoding text in
various web-savvy formats. There are three functions exported from the
html-encode package: encode-for-pre - encodes text so it's suitable
for inclusion in a HTML, encode-for-tt - attemps to encode the text so
it can display in a tag with proper spacing, encode-for-http - breaks
the string on ">" characters so that long lines aren't sent.
