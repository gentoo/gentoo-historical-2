Binary-types is a Common Lisp package for reading and writing binary
files. Binary-types provides macros that are used to declare the
mapping between lisp objects and some binary (i.e. octet-based)
representation.

Supported kinds of binary types include:

 * Signed and unsigned integers of any octet-size, big-endian or
   little-endian. Maps to lisp integers.

 * Enumerated types based on any integer type. Maps to lisp symbols.

 * Complex bit-field types based on any integer type. Sub-fields can
   be numeric, enumerated, or bit-flags. Maps to lisp lists of symbols
   and integers.

 * Fixed-length and null-terminated strings. Maps to lisp strings.

 * Compound records of other binary types. Maps to lisp DEFCLASS
   classes or, when you prefer, DEFSTRUCT structs.
