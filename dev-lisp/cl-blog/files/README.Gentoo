Gentoo GNU/Linux specific notes for CL-BLOG
-------------------------------------------

This is the README.Gentoo file from /usr/share/doc/@PF@/ directory.

  * The Gentoo port patches variables.lisp to prepare CL-BLOG for standard
    system-wide installation.

  * Sample configurations and templates distributed with CL-BLOG have been
    installed into /etc/cl-blog.  You are expected to changes these.  See the
    README distributed with CL-BLOG for some tips on how to configure CL-BLOG.

  * Initializing, starting and stopping CL-BLOG on whatever Common Lisp
    implementation and combination of additional libraries you are using is
    beyond the scope of this port.

  * A directory for blog entries have been created at /var/lib/cl-blog/entries/.
    Adjust ownership and permissions on this directory as needed.

If you encounter any problems or have suggestions, use http://bugs.gentoo.org.
Please don't bother the upstream authors unless you are absolutely certain it is
not Gentoo-related.
