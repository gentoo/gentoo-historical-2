<longdescription>
Lush is designed to be used in situations where one would want to
combine the flexibility of a high-level, loosely-typed interpreted
language, with the efficiency of a strongly-typed, natively-compiled
language, and with the easy integration of code written in C, C++, or
other languages.

Lush is not an implementation of Common Lisp.
