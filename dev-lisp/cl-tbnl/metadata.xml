TBNL is a toolkit for building dynamic websites with Common Lisp. It employs the
popular Apache web server for the actual http communication between the server
and the browser and it uses Marc Battyani's mod_lisp for the communication
between Apache and the Lisp image.

TBNL provides facilities like automatic session handling (with and without
cookies), logging to Apache's log files, customizable error handling, and easy
access to GET and POST parameters sent by the client. It does not include
functionality to programmatically generate HTML output. For this task you can
use any library you like.
