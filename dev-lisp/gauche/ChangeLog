*gauche-0.5.2 (12 Apr 2002)

  12 Apr 2002; Karl Trygve Kalleberg <karltk@gentoo.org> gauche-0.5.2.ebuild files/digest-gauche-0.5.2:

  Gauche is an R5RS Scheme implementation developed to be a handy script 
  interpreter, which allows programmers and system administrators to write 
  small to large scripts for their daily chores. Quick startup, built-in 
  system interface, native multilingual support are some of my goals.
