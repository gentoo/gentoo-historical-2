* Gentoo Specific Notes

** "The SBCL patch"

For Lambda-GTK to work on SBCL, a 3rd party patch is required for SBCL.  You can
enable this patch in SBCL via the "callbacks" USE flag.

** Generation of the FFI interface

The Gentoo port uses the default API target distributed with Lambda-GTK.

** Avoiding the CL-USER namespace

The Gentoo port includes an ASDF system which includes code to create a new
package "GTK-USER".  Symbols originally exported to the CL-USER package
namespace are instead exported to the GTK-USER package namespace.  The idea here
is to preserve CL-USER for the end user.

** Examples

Examples included with Lambda-GTK are available via the LAMBDA-GTK-EXAMPLES
definition system. ie.

    (asdf:oos 'asdf:load-op :lambda-gtk-examples)
    (gtk-user::scribble-simple)
    ...
