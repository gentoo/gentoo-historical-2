λgtk is a cross-platform Lisp interface to the complete GTK+2 family of shared
libraries.  λgtk provides Lisp programmers with the following set of features:

    * Portable GUI programming across the supported Lisp environments.

    * Automatic conversion between Lisp data (booleans, numbers, strings) and
      their equivalent GTK types.

    * Lisp names for GTK's enums, structs and functions. 

    * Lisp accessor functions to read/write slot values in GTK structs.

    * Lisp symbol package(s) that export the GTK API and a read time conditional
      #+:gtk in *features*.

    * A small set of utilities for working with GTK pointers, callbacks and
      foreign storage in a portable way.
