CL-MENUSYSTEM is a menu system for Common Lisp that implements menu
control and settings editing for CL applications. It has a number of
nifty features, including being based on CLOS, with separation of
backends (hypothetical as right now there's only one) and using
restarts for non-local exits from menus.
