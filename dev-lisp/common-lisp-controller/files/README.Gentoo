* IMPORTANT

The Common Lisp Controller (CLC) in Gentoo GNU/Linux is a modified
version of the original CLC sources from the Debian Project.  Do not
send bug reports to the Debian Project -- always send bug reports to
http://bugs.gentoo.org.

* NOTES

If you are used to the CLC in Debian, please note that the Gentoo CLC
does not require an Internet super-server such as inetd or xinetd in
order to function.  The original CLC implementation's clc-send-command
has been replaced with a shell script which implements the same
interface, but bypasses clc-build-daemon entirely.
