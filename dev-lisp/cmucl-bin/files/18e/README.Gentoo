* CMUCL Configuration

Please note, while you do not need to do anything special while
running cmucl itself (it is a wrapper script than sets environment
appropriately), you will nee to set few shell environment variables
before running the CMUCL configuration program, `config'

The following is the simplest chain of commands launch CMUCL config:

    cd /opt/cmucl/lib/cmucl/lib/
    CMUCLLIB=/opt/cmucl/lib/cmucl/lib PATH=$PATH:/opt/cmucl/bin ./config

* Site Configuration

/etc/common-lisp/cmucl/site-lisp.lisp has been installed.  This file
is intended for local, site-wide configuration of CMUCL.
