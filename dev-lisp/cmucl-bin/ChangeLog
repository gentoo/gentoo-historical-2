  18 Aug 2002; Karl Trygve Kalleberg <karltk@gentoo.org> cmucl-bin-18d-r1.ebuild files/digest-cmucl-bin-18d-r1:

  Man pages are not installed properly. Renamed /usr/bin/cmucl to 
  /usr/bin/lisp, to be legacy-compatible. This may change without notice in
  the future! Fixes #6555.

  Moved files/README.config, files/wrapper.script to files/18d/README.config,
  files/18d/wrapper.script.

  Removed cmucl-bin-18d.ebuild files/digest-cmucl-bin-18d

  From the web page:

  CMUCL is a free implementation of the Common Lisp programming language
  which runs on most major Unix platforms. It mainly conforms to the ANSI
  Common Lisp standard. Here is a summary of its main features:

    * a sophisticated native-code compiler which is capable of powerful
      type inferences, and generates code competitive in speed with C
      compilers.
    * generational garbage collection and multiprocessing capability on
      the x86 ports.
    * a foreign function interface which allows interfacing with C code
      and system libraries, including shared libraries on most
      platforms, and direct access to Unix system calls.
    * support for interprocess communication and remote procedure calls.
    * an implementation of CLOS, the Common Lisp Object System, which
      includes multimethods and a metaobject protocol.
    * a graphical source-level debugger using a Motif interface, and a
      code profiler.
    * an interface to the X11 Window System (CLX), and a sophisticated
      graphical widget library (Garnet).
    * programmer-extensible input and output streams.
    * an Emacs-like editor implemented in Common Lisp.
    * public domain: free, with full source code and no strings attached
      (and no warranty). Like the GNU/Linux and *BSD operating systems,
      CMUCL is maintained and improved by a team of volunteers
      collaborating over the Internet.
