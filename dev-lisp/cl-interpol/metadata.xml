CL-INTERPOL is a library for Common Lisp which modifies the reader so
that you can have interpolation within strings similar to Perl or Unix
Shell scripts. It also provides various ways to insert arbitrary
characters into literal strings even if your editor/IDE doesn't
support them. Here's an example:

* (let ((a 42))
    #?"foo: \xC4\N{U with diaeresis}\nbar: ${a}")

"foo: ÄÜ
bar: 42"
