Gentoo GNU/Linux specific notes for ECL
---------------------------------------

This is the README.Gentoo file from /usr/share/doc/@PF@/ directory.

  * The Gentoo port includes a patch to ECL's installed header file (ech.h) so
    that TRUE and FALSE are not redefined if they're already included from
    elsewhere. This makes it easier to use ECL with other software which defines
    those C preprocesser symbols (eg. glib-2.0).

  * Support for a kind of Common Lisp Controller is available since
    dev-lisp/ecls-0.9f_p1 but not enabled by default. The controller included in
    ECL simply puts /usr/share/common-lisp/systems/ into ASDF:*CENTRAL-REGISTRY*
    and extends ASDF:OUTPUT-FILES so that FASLs are placed into
    /var/cache/common-lisp-controller/<username>/ecl/.

    To use this controller, either copy /usr/share/doc/@PF@/clc-lite.lisp to
    your ~/.eclrc or source it from there.

  * ECL versus dev-lisp/cl-*: ECL 0.9f_p1 and later will compile a lot of the
    dev-lisp/cl-* ports. Quite a few ports will fail however. Should you come
    across a failure, consider isolating it in an ECL without the clc-lite.lisp
    code loaded. Submit your results preferably to the Gentoo Bugzilla or to
    upstream if you're absolutely sure it isn't Gentoo related.

If you encounter any problems or have suggestions, use http://bugs.gentoo.org.
Please don't bother the upstream authors unless you are absolutely certain it is
not Gentoo-related.
