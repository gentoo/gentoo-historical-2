FiveAM is a simple (as far as writing and running tests goes) regression testing
framework. It has been designed with Common Lisp's interactive development model
in mind. It features:

    * Test and test suite hierarchies allow test to be organized into
      hierarchies to ease running.
    * Functions for re-running recently run tests.
    * Inter-test dependencies.
