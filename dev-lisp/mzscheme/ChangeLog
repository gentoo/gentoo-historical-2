*mzscheme-103_pre1 ( 17 Feb 2002 )

  17 Feb 2002; Karl Trygve Kalleberg <karltk@gentoo.org> ChangeLog files/digest-mzscheme-103_pre1 mzscheme-103_pre1:
  
  MzScheme is an implementation of the Scheme programming language for 
  Windows 95/98/NT/2000, MacOS, Unix, and BeOS. MzScheme is R4RS-compliant 
  (including the full numerical tower) and nearly R5RS-compliant (some macro 
  support is lacking). MzScheme also provides:

    * Pre-emptive threads for all platforms
    * Generative structures (a.k.a. record datatypes)
    * Built-in exceptions; each primitive error raises a specific exception
    * First-class compilation units (modules) for organizing program components
    * A class-based object system reminiscent of C++/Java
    * Built-in regular expression matching tools
    * Simple TCP communication support on all platforms
    * Portable filesystem access procedures
    * Platform-specific process control, including AppleEvent support

  This ebuild does not pre-compile the standard-library, which is untested.
