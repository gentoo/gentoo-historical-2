  13 Apr 2002; Karl Trygve Kalleberg <karltk@gentoo.org> bigloo-lib-0.17.ebuild files/digest-bigloo-lib-0.17 :

  Bigloo-lib is a set of libraries for Bigloo, the Scheme programming language
  compiler (http://kaolin.unice.fr/bigloo/). Most of the libraries are 
  ready-to-use interfaces for various C-based packages, such as C runtime 
  library, Gtk++, LDAP client API or XML parser API. Other are done entirely 
  in `pure Scheme', such as HTTP library and NODE library.

  Besides, the bigloo-lib provides a comfortable framework to configure, 
  compile, install and deploy Bigloo (in particular, system-dependent) 
  libraries, so it is quite a good place to put code created by other Bigloo
  developers.
