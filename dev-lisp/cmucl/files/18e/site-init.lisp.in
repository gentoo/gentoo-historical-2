Welcome to CMUCL for Linux.

If you aren't running this with ilisp in emacs,
or aren't intending to use hemlock then you
deserve to lose. :-)

Read the documentation in /usr/share/doc/@PF@.

(quit) is to quit.
(ed) starts hemlock (if installed)
(demo) shows a list of demos
(describe 'progn) gives information about progn for 
 example.
(inspect '*a*) interactively inspects *a* for example.

General demos:
CLX demos:
 if you have installed cmucl-source you can do:
 (require :cmucl-clx)
 (load \"cl-library:cmucl-clx;demo;hello\")
 (xlib::hello-world \"\")
 (load \"cl-library:;cmucl-clx;demo;menu\")
 (xlib::just-say-lisp \"\")
 (xlib::pop-up \"\"
	       '(\"Linux\" \"FreeBSD\" \"OpenBSD\"))
  exit by pressing control+C followed by a keypress.

Clue demos:
 if you have installed the clue package you can do:
 (require :clue)
 (load \"cl-library:;clue;examples;menu\")
 (clue-examples::beatlemenuia \"\")
 (clue-examples::pick-one \"\"
			  \"One\"
			  \"Two\"
			  \"Three\")
 (clue-examples::just-say-lisp \"\")
 
 or you can use the Clio demos:
 (require :clio)
 (require :clio-examples)
 (clio-examples::sketch :host  \"\")

Pictures demos:
 (require :pictures)
 (load \"cl-library:;pictures;examples;road-demo\")
 (pictures::road-demo)
 press control-a to animate
