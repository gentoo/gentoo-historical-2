This file is README.Gentoo, from /usr/share/docs/cl-ucw-*/

* Introduction

UCW requires some configuration before use.  For example, you must choose the
web-server backend UCW will use (araneida, mod_lisp, aserve, httpd etc.),
choose the location of the UCW TAL root, adjust loggers, debugging verbosity
etc.

UCW provides some examples in the form of start.lisp, and utils.lisp.  Both
of which can be found in /usr/share/docs/cl-ucw-*/.  Use those examples as
templates for your own configurations.  Your start.lisp and utils.lisp should
be located in the same directory.

* Gentoo Defaults

Gentoo installs a default TAL root in /var/lib/ucw/wwwroot/

Gentoo installs a default logger path at /var/logs/ucw/

The start.lisp included in the Gentoo distribution of UCW makes use of the
above paths by default (see the sections 3. TAL root and section 4. Setup
loggers in start.lisp).  If you wish to change the details of a web-server
backend, you'll need to change utils.lisp.

You will need to adjust the permissions of /var/logs/ucw/ to suit whatever
system user ID you intend to run UCW under.  Alternatively you could set the
path passed to SETUP-LOGGERS to your own choice in logging directory.

* Starting UCW

Once you have adjusted your start.lisp and utils.lisp, start UCW within your
Lisp REPL like this:

    (asdf:oos 'adsf:load-op :ucw)
    (load "/path/to/start.lisp")

By default, the admin and examples applications are available at:

    http://127.0.0.1:<port>/ucw/admin/index.ucw
    http://127.0.0.1:<port>/ucw/examples/index.ucw

Where <port> is 8080 for the "httpd" backend, 3001 for the "mod-lisp" backend
and 8080 for the "aserve" or "araneida" backends.
