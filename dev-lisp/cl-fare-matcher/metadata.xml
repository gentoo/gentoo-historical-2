<longdescription>
A library of macros and functions by Fare Rideau.  It extends CL with
pattern matching much like ML, but in a way well integrated with CL,
and with the possibility of extending the core matcher with arbitrary
primitives.  This port is that of Matthew Danish's fare-matcher which
has some extensions and clean-ups, packaged with an ASDF system.
