KR (Knowledge Representation) is a highly flexible and dynamic
prototype-based object system for Common Lisp. It is completely
independent of CLOS and features among other things
multiple-inheritance and value propagation using constraints, much
like Cells or COSI do, but in case of the latter there is actual
source code around.
