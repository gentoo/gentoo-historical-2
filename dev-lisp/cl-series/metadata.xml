This is Richard C. Waters' SERIES package for Common Lisp.

A series is a data structure much like a sequence, with similar kinds of
operations. The difference is that in many situations, operations on series may
be composed functionally and yet execute iteratively, without the need to
construct intermediate series values explicitly. In this manner, series provide
both the clarity of a functional programming style and the efficiency of an
iterative programming style.
