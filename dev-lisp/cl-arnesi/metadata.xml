<longdescription>
arnesi is a collection of small bits and pieces of common lisp
code. It includes, among other things: * usefull flow control macros -
while, whichever, if-bind, etc. * a simple logging facility
kind-of/sort-of/maybe like log4j. * url and html escaping * list
pattern matching * collecting and reducing macros * an ad-hoc, bug
ridden implementation of half of call/cc.  * hygenic macros
