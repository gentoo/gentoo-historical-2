* Gentoo Specific Notes for Araneida

** Documentation

Araneida comes with a HTML reference manual.  In Gentoo the normal installation
path for HTML documentation is /usr/share/doc/cl-araneida-*/html/, however
Araneida's documentation references part of its source code.  Indeed the HTML is
part of its definition system.  Therefore, you can find the HTML documentation
for Araneida at:

    file:///usr/share/common-lisp/source/araneida/doc/index.html

** Reverse Web Proxies

Araneida benifits from a reverse web proxy for deployments, however a proxy
isn't really required while you develop with Araneida.  Nonetheless, the choice
between two reverse web proxy servers has been included in the runtime
dependency list:

    www-servers/apache
    www-servers/pound

See the CLiki at http://www.cliki.net/Araneida for more information on this.
