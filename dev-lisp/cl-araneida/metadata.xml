Araneida is a fairly small free extensible Web server for SBCL and
many other Common Lisp implementations. CLiki is an Araneida
application.  

  *  Works with or without multiple threads (depending on the lisp
  implementation). In single-threaded mode, hooks into the event loop
  so that you still have the top-level available while it listens for
  connections.

  * Designed to sit behind a caching proxy; can write appropriate bits
  of Apache config. If this bothers you, pretend that mod_proxy is a
  typo for mod_araneida. This includes playing nicely with SSL

  * Understands HTTP/1.1 Host: header for multiple host support

  * All content is dynamic and created by calling user-defined
  handlers (there is a handler in there already that outputs files, if
  you need it)

  * Pattern-matching tree rewrite functions and HTML-from-sexpr
  generation makes balancing tags suddenly trivially simple

  * Runs on multiple Lisps. As of version 0.9, these are SBCL, CMUCL,
  OpenMCL, ABCL, CLisp, Allegro Common Lisp, and LispWorks. MCL is
  supported in CVS. This makes Araneida the most portable Common Lisp
  web server.
