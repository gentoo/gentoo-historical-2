wmalms monitors data obtained from a sensor chip: 
temperature, fan speed, and voltage.   It can be 
used as a dockable/swallowed applet with Window 
Maker or any window manager that supports 
swallowing, including GNOME, kwm (KDE), fvwm, 
and its clones. Alternatively, you can run wmalms 
as a normal window with any window manager.   
wmalms is designed to suit any hardware supported 
by lm_sensors. It provides a wide range of 
customized features, including window appearence, 
order and representation of sensor data, refresh 
frequency, alarm mode, etc.
