*wmtz-0.7 (4-Aug-2002)

  17 Jan 2003; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> wmtz-0.7.ebuild :

  Put the config file in /etc as a default.  Also, removed WindowMaker as a
  DEPEND, since it's spurious.

  Added to portage.  Made some minor changes to the initial ebuild.

  4 Aug 2002; Matthew Schlegel <nitehawk-gentoo@1ststep.net>  wmtz-0.7.ebuild :
  First version of the package.
