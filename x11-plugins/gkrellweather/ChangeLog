  30 May 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> gkrellweather-0.2.7-r2.ebuild :

  Hmmm.  The GrabWeather script is hardcoded into /usr/share/gkrellm only
  in the Debian version.  I added the debian patch which does just that.

*gkrellweather-0.2.7-r1 (18 Mar 2002)

  18 Mar 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> gkrellweather-0.2.7-r1.ebuild :

  Adjusted copyright, and made the script go into /usr/share/gkrellm where it is
  expected, instead of /usr/bin.  The expected location of the GrabWeather
  script seems to be hardcoded.

  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about

  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
