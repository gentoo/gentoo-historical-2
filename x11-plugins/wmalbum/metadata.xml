WMAlbum is a dock applet that displays album covers for songs being played by XMMS. You must already have images of the album covers stored near the file being played. WMAlbum provides a handy circular menu for play/skip/etc, and can replace wmxmms. Although dock applets are designed for the WindowMaker window manager, they also work in other window managers including openbox and blackbox.
