*gkrellm-gnome-0.1 (14 Apr 2002)

  29 Aug 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> * :

  Relocated to x11-plugins

  17 Apr 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> gkrellm-gnome-0.1.ebuild :

  Added gnome-libs to the DEPEND list

  14 Apr 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> gkrellm-gnome-0.1.ebuild :

  Removed glibc from the DEPEND list, because that is implied.  And also 
  removed gnome-core from the DEPEND list, because it is not a dependency.
  This plugin merely creates hints and such, and only interacts with the 
  gnome panel if it is present.
