  This is the Jabber server configuration file. The file is
  broken into different sections based on the services being 
  managed by jabberd, the server daemon. Most of the important 
  sections have comments and are easy to modify.

  At http://jabberd.jabberstudio.org/1.4/ you find further
  instructions including an annotated version of this con-
  figuration file and an installation guide.
  
  Note that when you see a tag like "jabberd:cmdline", it's
  automatically replaced on startup with the command line flag
  passed in to jabberd. This enables you to override para-
  meters set in this configuration file if necessary or de-
  sired. Also note as you comment things in and out that
  jabberd does not like comments within comments, so be care-
  ful with your XML. :)

      IDs with admin access - these people will receive admin 
      messages (any message to="yourhostname" is an admin
      message).  These addresses must be local ids, they cannot
      be remote addresses.

      Note that they can also send announcements to all
      users of the server, or to all online users. To use
      the announcement feature, you need to send raw xml and be
      logged in as one of the admin users. Here is the syntax 
      for sending an announcement to online users:

        <message to="yourhostname/announce/online">
          <body>announcement here</body>
        </message>

        </message>

      Sending to /announce/motd/delete will remove any existing
      motd, and to /announce/motd/update will only update the motd
      without re-announcing to all logged in users.

      The <reply> will be the message that is automatically

  The following service manages incoming client socket connections.
  There are several items you can set here to optimize performance:

    * authtime - default is unlimited, but you can set this to
      limit the amount of time allowed for authentication to be
      completed, e.g., <authtime>10</authtime> for 10 seconds

    * heartbeat - default is to not send out heartbeat packets
      to the clients.  This option allows you to specify that
      you want heartbeats to happen every x seconds.  This is
      useful if you have a lot of dial-up or laptop users who
      may drop their connection without logging off of jabber.
      Otherwise the server won't notice that they are offline until
      someone tries to send a packet to them (and the message is
      lost).  Example: <heartbeat>60</heartbeat>

    * karma - this is an input/output rate limiting system that
      the Jabber team came up with to prevent bandwidth hogging.
      For details about karma, read the io section at the bottom.
      These are the low settings and apply per connection/socket
      and can be changed as desired.
      To disable rate limiting just delete the <karma/> section.

    <!-- definition of terms:

      * Avg. Throughput - The number of bytes you can
        send every second without incuring any penalty.

      * Burst Allowed - The maximum number of bytes you
        can send in 2 seconds without incurring any penalty.

      * Max Sustained Rate - If you send data as fast as 
        you can, you will hit penalty, and will not be 
        able to send for 10 seconds; the max sustained 
        rate is the average rate you can dump data when 
        you are dumping as much data as you can, as fast 
        as you can.

      * Seconds to Recover from Burst - The amount of time 
        it will take to reach Avg. Throughput capability 
        after sending a max burst of data.

      * Penalty Length - The length of your penalty is
        determined according to this formula:
              abs(penalty) * Heartbeat seconds
        E.g., a penalty of -5 and heartbeat of 2 will 
        cause your penalty length to be 10 seconds. 
   Note that a penalty CANNOT be less than -100, 
        otherwise strange things might happen.
