# Name of your ejabberd node. Used by ejabberdctl to determine which
# node to communicate with.
EJABBERD_NODE="ejabberd@`hostname -s`"

# Max number of open network connections. Default is 1024. Increasing
# this will slightly increase memory usage.
#ERL_MAX_PORTS=1024

# Return memory to the system after using it, instead of keeping it
# allocated for future use. Decreases the memory required by ejabberd,
# but makes it run slower.  Default is unset, set to any value to
# activate.
