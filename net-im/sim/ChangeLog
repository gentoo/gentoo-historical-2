  05 Dec 2002; Dan Armak <danarmak@gentoo.org> ChangeLog  :

  Add patch to fix compilation problems. Hopefully close bugs #9385 and #9567.

*sim-0.8 (25 Oct 2002)

  25 Oct 2002; Dan Armak <danarmak@gentoo.org> ChangeLog  :

  New upstream release.

*sim-0.7 (12 Sep 2002)

  12 Sep 2002; Dan Armak <danarmak@gentoo.org> ChangeLog  :

  New upstream version. Also readded support for turning kde support off,
  thus closing bug #6003. Also added the proper USE ssl -controlled deps
  and configure options for openssl support.

*sim-0.6 (28 Jul 2002)

  28 Jul 2002; Dan Armak <danarmak@gentoo.org> ChangeLog  :

  Initial ebuild. Closes submission #4915 by Julian Scheel.
  Although sim is capable of running without kde (qt only), I had problems
  with that and at least
  for now (and likely until someone asks me to try again) the ebuild always
  enables KDE support.
