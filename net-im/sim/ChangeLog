*sim-0.6 (28 Jul 2002)

  28 Jul 2002; Dan Armak <danarmak@gentoo.org> ChangeLog  :

  Initial ebuild. Closes submission #4915 by Julian Scheel.
  Although sim is capable of running without kde (qt only), I had problems
  with that and at least
  for now (and likely until someone asks me to try again) the ebuild always
  enables KDE support.
