 <longdescription>Mercury is a Java Based MSN client.
 
 With Mercury you can do the same things as with your normal messenger:
     * Talk to friends
     * Change your nickname and status
     * Add a display picture (also know as avatar)
     * Send files through the msn server (for people with a firewall etc..) or direct
     * Play games (Tic Tac Toe and Connect4 only at the moment) </longdescription>
