*gnomeicu-0.98.3 (31 Jul 2002)
  31 Jul 2002; Gabriele Giorgetti <stroke@gentoo.org> gnomeicu-0.98.3.ebuild :
  New version.

*gnomeicu-0.98.2-r5 (30 Jul 2002)
  30 Jul 2002; Gabriele Giorgetti <stroke@gentoo.org> gnomeicu-0.98.2-r5.ebuild : 
  Disabled socks5 support. Also fixes bug #3775
  If socks5 is in USE gnomeicu will not build, failing with the 'undefined 
  reference to SOCKSinit' error. This is because we don't have anything to 
  support socks5 in portage as far as I know.

*gnomeicu-0.98.2-r4 (30 Jul 2002)

  30 Jul 2002; Maik Schreiber <blizzy@gentoo.org> : Fixed compilation
  issue with socks, closing bug #5224. Also fixed sandbox violation
  issues.

*gnomeicu-0.98.2-r3 (28 Jun 2002)

  28 Jun 2002; Spider <spider@gentoo.org> : moved the gnome-core dep
  to the new gnome-panel. keeping the gnome USE flag since its nice :)
   
*gnomeicu-0.98.2-r2 (13 Jun 2002)

  13 Jun 2002; Spider <spider@gentoo.org> : make a "gnome" useflag that
  depends on gnome-core. to have -gnome means you won't have the panel
  applet built, which is a good thing for gnome2

  10 Jun 2002; Spider <spider@gentoo.org> : some dep changes

*gnomeicu-0.98 (01 Feb 2002)

  01 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
  
  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
