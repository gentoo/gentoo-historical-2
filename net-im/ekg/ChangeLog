  New client for gadu-gadu messenger protocol for my Polish friends. This ebuild
  thanks to: Michal 'Spock' Januszewski <spock@o2.pl> and Piotr Piasny

  sorry for the delay in getting it into portage.  I hope you will all help
  me to maintain this package and fixing bugs with it. (Will be cc'ing all
  of you on bug reports).
