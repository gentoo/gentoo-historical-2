Jessie is a free, clean-room implementation of the Java Secure Sockets
Extension, the JSSE. It provides the core API for programming network
sockets with the Secure Socket Layer (SSL), which creates an
authenticated, unforgeable, and protected layer around network
communications. Its goal is to be a drop-in package for free Java class
libraries such as Classpath and its derivatives, and is being written to
depend only on free software, and only with the API specification and
the public protocol specifications.

Included in this package are a clean-room implementation of the
javax.net, javax.net.ssl, and javax.security.cert packages, and a JSSE
provider that implements the SSL version 3 and TLS version 1 protocols.

Jessie is distributed under the terms of the GNU Gereral Public License.
The implementations of javax.net, javax.net.ssl, and javax.security.cert
packages are additionally covered by the following exception:

    "Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules
    is making a combined work based on this library. Thus, the terms and
    conditions of the GNU General Public License cover the whole
    combination.
    
    "As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library
     give you permission to link this library with independent
     modules to produce an executable, regardless of the license
     terms of these independent modules, and to copy and distribute
     the resulting executable under terms of your choice, provided
     that you also meet, for each linked independent module, the
     terms and conditions of the license of that module. An
     independent module is a module which is not derived from or
     based on this library. If you modify this library, you may
     extend this exception to your version of the library, but you
     are not obligated to do so. If you do not wish to do so, delete
     this exception statement from your version."
        
"JESSIE" stands for "JESSIE Executes Secure Sockets In Excess".
