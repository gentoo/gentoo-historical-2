*jdbc-mysql-3.0.8 (04 Jun 2003)

  04 Jun 2003; Dylan Carlson <absinthe@gentoo.org> jdbc-mysql-3.0.8.ebuild:
  Bugfix version bump. Closes #22178.
  
  Changes in this version:
  * Allow bogus URLs in Driver.getPropertyInfo().
  * Return list of generated keys when using multi-value INSERTS with
    Statement.getGeneratedKeys().
  * Use JVM charset with filenames and 'LOAD DATA [LOCAL] INFILE'
  * Fix infinite loop with Connection.cleanup().
  * Changed Ant target 'compile-core' to 'compile-driver', and made testsuite
    compilation a separate target.
  * Fixed result set not getting set for Statement.executeUpdate(), which 
    affected getGeneratedKeys() and getUpdateCount() in some cases.
  * Unicode character 0xFFFF in a string would cause the driver to throw an
    ArrayOutOfBoundsException
  * Return correct amount of generated keys when using 'REPLACE' statements.
  * Fix problem detecting server character set in some cases.
  * Fix row data decoding error when using _very_ large packets.
  * Optimized row data decoding.
  * Issue exception when operating on an already-closed prepared statement.
  * Fixed SJIS encoding bug, thanks to Naoto Sato.
  * Optimized usage of EscapeProcessor.
  * Fixed numbering of KEY_SEQ column in DBMD.getImported/Exported keys 
  * Allow multiple calls to Statement.close()
  * Use hex escaping for PreparedStatement.setBytes()/setBinaryStream() when 
    the character set is Shift_JIS, workaround for parsing bug in server.
  * Added whitespace insensitivity to EscapeProcessor.

*jdbc-mysql-2.0.14 (14 May 2003)

  14 May 2003; Dylan Carlson <absinthe@gentoo.org> jdbc-mysql-2.0.14.ebuild,
  jdbc-mysql-3.0.7.ebuild:
  "mmmysql" has been retired from Sourceforge, and is now officially part of
  MySQL's family, now known as Connector/J. In an effort to also keep the naming
  consistent with other jdbc offerings, this port is being renamed to
  jdbc-mysql. 
  
  The name of the JAR file has changed as well, so please make a note of it.
