  01 May 2002; Matthew Kennedy <mkennedy@gentoo.org> ChangeLog,
  xerces-2.0.1.ebuild, files/xerces-2.0.1.ebuild : New ebuild.  Xerces2 is the
  next generation of high performance, fully compliant XML parsers in the
  Apache Xerces family. This new version of Xerces introduces the Xerces Native
  Interface (XNI), a complete framework for building parser components and
  configurations that is extremely modular and easy to program.
