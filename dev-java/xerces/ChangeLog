*xerces-2.0.1 (1 May 2002)

  1 May 2002; Matthew Kennedy <mkennedy@gentoo.org> ChangeLog,
  xerces-2.0.1.ebuild, files/xerces-2.0.1.ebuild :
  
  New ebuild.

  Xerces2 is the next generation of high performance, fully compliant
  XML parsers in the Apache Xerces family. This new version of Xerces
  introduces the Xerces Native Interface (XNI), a complete framework
  for building parser components and configurations that is extremely
  modular and easy to program.
