*jakarta-regexp-1.2 (03 Jun 2002)

  03 Jun 2002; Karl Trygve Kalleberg <karltk@gentoo.org> jakarta-regexp-1.2.ebuild files/digest-jakarta-regexp-1.2 :

  Regexp is a 100% Pure Java Regular Expression package that was graciously 
  donated to the Apache Software Foundation by Jonathan Locke. He originally 
  wrote this software back in 1996 and it has stood up quite well to the test 
  of time. It includes complete Javadoc documentation as well as a simple 
  Applet for visual debugging and testing suite for compatibility. 

  Ebuild contributed by Jordan Armstrong <jordan@papercrane.net>
