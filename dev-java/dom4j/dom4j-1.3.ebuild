	einfo "dom4j.jar this contains all the dom4j code and the XPath engine but
	without the SAX or DOM interfaces. Usually the SAX and DOM 
	interfaces come bundled with a JAXP parser so if you are using 
	JAXP and crimson.jar or xerces.jar then dom4j.jar is the 
	recommended JAR	to use."

	einfo "dom4j-core.jar this contains all the dom4j code without the XPath 
	engine and the SAX and DOM interfaces. This JAR is intended 
	for developers who wish to keep the dom4j.jar and the jaxen.jar 
	JARs seperate."
