*jformatstring-1.0 (10 Apr 2011)

  10 Apr 2011; Steve Arnold <nerdboy@gentoo.org> +jformatstring-0.9.ebuild,
  +metadata.xml:
  New ebuild; required dependency for FindBugs.  Code seems stable for 
  quite some time.  Exported from trunk and packaged for the mirrors 
  (however, the upstream site appears to have lost the package).
