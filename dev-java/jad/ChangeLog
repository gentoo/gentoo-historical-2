  Jad is a Java decompiler, i.e. program that reads one or more Java class 
  files and converts them into Java source files which can be compiled again.

  Jad is a 100% pure C++ program and it generally works several times faster 
  than decompilers written in Java. Jad doesn't use the Java runtime for its 
  functioning, therefore no special setup is required (like changes to the 
  CLASSPATH variable).
