*jcommander-1.32 (16 Sep 2013)

  16 Sep 2013; Tom Wijsman <TomWij@gentoo.org> +files/jcommander-1.32-build.xml,
  +jcommander-1.32.ebuild:
  Version bump to 1.32. EAPI 5. Simplified using vcs-snapshot and archive URL.
  Made use of java-ant-2 to introduce javadoc functionality, will also allow for
  an easier src_test phase and solving of future build related problems.
  RESTRICT="test" still in place due to a circular dependency on itself, seems
  like some kind of bootstrapping or stripping is needed in order to get rid of
  the circular dependency.

  31 Dec 2012; Diego E. Pettenò <flameeyes@gentoo.org> +jcommander-1.30.ebuild:

  10 Aug 2012; Diego E. Pettenò <flameeyes@gentoo.org> +jcommander-1.29.ebuild,
