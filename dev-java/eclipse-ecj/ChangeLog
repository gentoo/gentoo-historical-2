*eclipse-ecj-3.1 (24 Aug 2005)

  24 Aug 2005; Karl Trygve Kalleberg <karltk@gentoo.org>
  +eclipse-ecj-3.1.ebuild:
  Initial import. The source snapshot was ripped straight out of
  plugins/org.eclipse.jdt.core from the 3.1 zipfile. Note that the
  directory layout has changed a bit; I don't maintain separate
  batch and compiler directories. Our layout looks exactly like the
  one used for the bootstrap compiler in jdtcoresrc/.
