*oro-2.0.6-r1 (24 Nov 2002)

  24 Nov 2002; Adrian Almenar <strider@gentoo.org> oro-2.0.6-r1.ebuild files/digest-oro-2.0.6-r1 :
  Just a minor fix, but needed to bump revision cause changed name of the jar 
  to avoid conflicts in future. Releasing it, since it has been tested a lot and
  works very well. Eliminated KEYWORDS without testing. Added Error Messages.
  Eliminated Docs info.
