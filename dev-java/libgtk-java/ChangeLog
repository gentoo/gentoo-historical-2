* libgtk-java-2.4.7.2 (27 Dec 2004)

  27 Dec 2004; Andrew Cowie <andrew@operationaldynamics.com> +libgtk-java-2.4.7.2.ebuild:
  Upstream stable maintenance release. Note that 2.4.7 had a bug which
  prevented it from building, and that 2.4.7.1 had its internal version numbers
  wrong.

* libgtk-java-2.4.6-r2 (24 Dec 2004)

  24 Dec 2004; Andrew Cowie <andrew@operationaldynamics.com> +libgtk-java-2.4.6-r2.ebuild, 
  -libgtk-java-2.4.6-r1.ebuild:
  Version bump to ensure pickup of Thomas's patch.

  29 Nov 2004; Thomas Matthijs <axxo@gentoo.org> +files/libgtk-java-2.4.6_find_jni.patch,
  libgtk-java-2.4.6-r1.ebuild:
  added a patch to set JAVA_INCLUDES when not using gcj, so it can find jni.h
  & familiy, #72128

* libgtk-java-2.4.6-r1 (15 Nov 2004)

  15 Nov 2004; Andrew Cowie <andrew@operationaldynamics.com> +libgtk-java-2.4.6-r1.ebuild:
  Dependency on docbook-sgml-utils discovered by karltk; investigation showed
  it to be highly unnecessary and an artifact of some (currently) unused cruft
  in the documentation. Fixed by patching the java-gnome autoconf macros to
  remove the path check for docbook2html.

* libgtk-java-2.4.6 (07 Nov 2004)

  07 Nov 2004; Andrew Cowie <andrew@operationaldynamics.com>:
  New ebuild. What used to be java-gnome is now multiplexed into various modular
  subcomponents. Upstream CVS was all re-arranged, and now there is a release
  tarball for each piece. This ebuild is the java binding around the core GTK
  libraries (and is the only one of the new pieces which doesn't need the rest of
  GNOME installed).
