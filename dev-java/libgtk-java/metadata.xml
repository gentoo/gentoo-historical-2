		An elegant set of language bindings to allow you to write
		native GTK applications in Java. Works in both normal Java VMs
		and also with GCJ allowing the creation of native Linux
		executable binaries.

		This library comes from the java-gnome project, which in turn
		is part of the official suite of GNOME language bindings.

		These are the Java bindings for GTK, the only one of the
		java-gnome libraries which doesn't need the rest of GNOME
		installed. If you *do* have GNOME installed, then you probably
		want to emerge java-gnome which is a meta package which depends
		on the various libraries which make up the complete java-gnome
		language binding suite.
