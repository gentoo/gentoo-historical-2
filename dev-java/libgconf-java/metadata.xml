		An elegant set of language bindings to allow you to write
		native GNOME applications in Java. Works with both traditional
		Java VMs and also with GCJ, allowing the creation of native
		Linux executable binaries.

		This library comes from the java-gnome project, which in turn
		is part of the official suite of GNOME language bindings.

		This ebuild contains the Java bindings around the GConf
		libraries.

		If you're interested in this you probably want to emerge
		java-gnome - a meta package which in turn depends on the
		various GNOME libraries which comprise the complete java-gnome
		language binding suite. More probably, some program that uses
		gets at gconf via the java-gnome libraries will be bringing it
		in for you.
