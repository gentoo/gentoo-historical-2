		The Scala Bazaar system, "sbaz" in short, is a system used by Scala enthusiasts to share computer files with each other. In particular, it makes it easy to share libraries and applications. Just like with a real-life bazaar, working within a bazaar provides you with extra opportunities offered by other people, and gives you an easy way to share any offerings you wish to make to others in the community.
