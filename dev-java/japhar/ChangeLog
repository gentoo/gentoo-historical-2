  Japhar is the Hungry Programmers'  Java VM. It has been built from the 
  ground up without consulting Sun's sources.

  Japhar is released under the LGPL, which should make it much more attractive
  for companies interested in embedding an open source JVM in their 
  proprietary/commercial products. For example, the LGPL is compatible with 
  Netscape's NPL license, and allows Japhar to be included into Mozilla.
