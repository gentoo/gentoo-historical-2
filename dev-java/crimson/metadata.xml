Crimson is a Java XML parser which supports XML 1.0 via the following
APIs:
* Java API for XML Processing (JAXP) 1.1 minus the javax.xml.transform
  package. JAXP is a pluggable API that allows applications to access XML
  documents in a parser-independent manner. It endorses the industry
  standard SAX and DOM APIs and also adds a few classes under the
  javax.xml.parsers package to implement pluggability and utility methods.
  Note: the javax.xml.transform package hierarchy of JAXP is not
  implemented by Crimson. One implementation of javax.xml.transform can be
  found at Xalan Java 2.
* SAX 2.0
* SAX2 Extensions version 1.0
* DOM Level 2 Core Recommendation
