*jaxp-1.2-r1 (29 Apr 2002)

  29 Apr 2002; Karl Trygve Kalleberg <karltk@gentoo.org> jaxp-1.2-r1.ebuild files/digest-jaxp-1.2-r1:

  Upstream package was updated. Direct URL is now in the ebuild so we can 
  download directly. The jaxp license is _very_ restrictive, so a warning
  is now issued when the package has been installed. 

  This will have to be updated when the ACCEPT_LICENSE functionality goes 
  into Portage.

  Removed jaxp-1.2.ebuild files/digest-jaxp-1.2

*jaxp-1.2 (1 Feb 2002)

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
  
  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
