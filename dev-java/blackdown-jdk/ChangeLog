*blackdown-jdk-1.3.1-r5 (24 Apr 2002)

  24 Apr 2002; Karl Trygve Kalleberg <karltk@gentoo.org> blackdown-jdk-1.3.1-r5.ebuild files/digest-blackdown-jdk-1.3.1-r5:

  When compiling certain versions of PHP with Blackdown, libhpi.so was not 
  found. A workaround whereby the proper directories for Blackdown are added
  to the system's LDPATH is included in this revision. This should also take 
  care of other malfunctioning configure scripts like PHP's.
