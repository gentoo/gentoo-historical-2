wx4j is a Java binding for wxWidgets providing a Java GUI toolkit using 
native widgets. Since wx4j uses native widgets, it utilizes the native 
look and feel. This is in contrast to Swing/JFC which tries to mimic 
the native look and feel, but usually doesn't quite feel right. In this 
respect, it is very similar to the SWT toolkit used in IBM's Eclipse IDE. 
But rather than inventing yet another toolkit, wx4j utilizes the proven 
wxWidgets C++ library and uses SWIG to expose the API in Java. This also 
means the event loop executes in C++ and is very responsive.
