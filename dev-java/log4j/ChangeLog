*dev-java/log4j-1.1.3 (10 Apr 2002)

  10 Apr 2002; Karl Trygve Kalleberg <karltk@gentoo.org> ChangeLog log4j-1.1.3.ebuild files/digest-log4j-1.1.3:

  With log4j it is possible to enable logging at runtime without modifying the
  application binary. The log4j package is designed so that the logging 
  statements can remain in shipped code without incurring a heavy performance
  cost. Logging behavior can be controlled by editing a configuration file, 
  without touching the application binary.
