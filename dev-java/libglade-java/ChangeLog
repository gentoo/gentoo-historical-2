* libglade-java-2.8.2.2 (27 Dec 2004)

  27 Dec 2004; Andrew Cowie <andrew@operationaldynamics.com> +libglade-java-2.8.2.2.ebuild:
  New upstream with the fix below. Note that 2.8.2.1 had an internal version 
  number glitch

* libglade-java-2.8.2-r1 (24 Dec 2004)

  24 Dec 2004; Andrew Cowie <andrew@operationaldynamics.com> +libglade-java-2.8.2-r1.ebuild, -libglade-java-2.8.2.ebuild:
  Nasty little bug with respect to signal connection. Luckily, simple fix.
  See gnome.org bug #161190 which in turn is based on Red Hat bug #141713. This
  will go away very shortly if a new upstream is released (largely and only 
  containing this patch).

  18 Nov 2004; Andrew Cowie <andrew@operationaldynamics.com> libglade-java-2.8.2.ebuild:
  Marked stable on x86

* libglade-java-2.8.2 (08 Nov 2004)

  08 Nov 2004; Andrew Cowie <andrew@operationaldynamics.com>:
  New ebuild. What used to be java-gnome is now multiplexed into various modular
  subcomponents. Upstream CVS was all re-arranged, and now there is a release
  tarball for each piece. This is the Java binding for LibGlade.

* libglade-java-2.8.2 (04 Dec 2004)

  04 Dec 2004; Karl Trygve Kalleberg <karltk@gentoo.org> :
  Initial import. Fixes #70561.
