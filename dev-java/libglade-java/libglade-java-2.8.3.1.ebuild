# WARNING: Because java-gnome is a set of bindings to native GNOME libraries, 
# it has, like any GNOME project, a massive autoconf setup, and unlike many 
# other java libraries, it has its own [necessary] `make install` step.
# As a result, this ebuild is VERY sensitive to the internal layout of the
# upstream project. Because these issues are currently evolving upstream,
# simply version bumping this ebuild is not likely to work but FAILURES WILL
# BE VERY SUBTLE IF IT DOES NOT WORK.
