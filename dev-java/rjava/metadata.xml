rJava is a simple R-to-Java interface. It is comparable to the .C/.Call C 
interface. rJava provides a low-level bridge between R and Java (via JNI). 
In a sense the inverse of rJava is JRI (Java/R Interface) which provides 
the opposite direction - calling R from Java. JRI is now shipped as a part 
of the rJava package, although it still can be used as a separate entity 
(especially for development).
