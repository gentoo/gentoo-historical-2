  Maven is a Java project management and project comprehension tool. Maven is
  based on the concept of a project object model (POM) in that all the artifacts
  produced by Maven are a result of consulting a well defined model for your
  project. Builds, documentation, source metrics, and source cross-references
  are all controlled by your POM.
