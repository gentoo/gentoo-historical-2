		An elegant set of language bindings to allow you to write
		native GNOME applications in Java. Works with both traditional
		Java VMs and also with GCJ, allowing the creation of native
		Linux executable binaries.

		This library comes from the java-gnome project, which in turn
		is part of the official suite of GNOME language bindings.

		These are the Java bindings for the core GNOME libraries (which
		therefore depends on a fairly complete and modern GNOME
		installation). If you *do* have GNOME installed, then you
		probably want to emerge java-gnome - a meta package which in
		turn depends on the various GNOME libraries which comprise the
		complete java-gnome language binding suite.
