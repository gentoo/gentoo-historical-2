    xxxterm is a minimalist web browser with sophisticated security features
	designed-in (rather than provided via an add-on). In particular, it provides
	both persistent and per-session tunables for scripts and cookies, making it
	easy to thwart tracking and scripting attacks.

	It strives to be vi-like for heavy keyboard users while maintaining
	traditional web browser behavior.

	The default settings provide a secure environment. With simple keyboard
	commands, the user can "whitelist" specific sites, allowing cookies and
	scripts from those sites.
