<longdescription>IPP2P uses suitable search patterns to identify P2P traffic thus allowing
the reliable identification of traffic belonging to many P2P networks. Once identified one
may handle P2P traffic in different ways - dropping such traffic, putting into low priority
classes or shaping to a given bandwidth limit is possible. Reducing costs, freeing network
resources and therefore improving network performance is often the result of using IPP2P.</longdescription>
