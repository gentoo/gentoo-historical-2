KMyFirewall attempts to make it easier to setup IPTables based firewalls on Linux systems.
It will be the right tool if you like to have a so called "Personal Firewall" running on 
your Linux box, but don't have the time and/or the interest to spend hours in front of 
the IPTables manual just to setup a Firewall that keeps the "bad" people out.
