		support.</flag>
	<flag name="autostart">Uses a custom autostart configuration gleened from

	<flag name="dbox2">describe</flag>
	<flag name="debug">Instructs Qt to use the 'debug' target instead of

	<flag name="frontendonly" restrict="&gt;media-tv/mythtv-0.21">Allows one to

		known that it does not compile all the addon programs that the frontend
		may use.</flag>
	<flag name="hdhomerun">Allows MythTV to communicate to HDHomeRun devices and
		receive your TV input from those sources.</flag>
	<flag name="ieee1394">Allows MythTV to communicate and use Firewire enabled
		Cable boxes. These are typically found in the United States, where such
		support is required by law. This will also install Firewire test
		programs and external channel changers if the internal changer does not
		work.</flag>

		Hauppauge cards which output analog TV directly in MPEG2 format.
