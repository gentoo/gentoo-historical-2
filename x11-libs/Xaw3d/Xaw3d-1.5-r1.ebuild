# Ok, hopefully this will resolv the problem with the version of libXaw3d that
# gets created.
#
# The problem its seems, is that when X gets compiled, it determines (with the
# help of some very dark magic) what version libXaw.so it it should build (6.1 or
# 7.0).  Now, when compiling Xaw3d, it checks which version of Xaw was built, and
# then builds the same version of Xaw3d.
#
# Since this ebuild use the Makefile's "install" function, it "should" not be a
# problem anymore.
#
# Azarah.
