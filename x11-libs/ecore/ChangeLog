*ecore-0.0.2 (20 Apr 2002)

  20 Apr 2002; Leigh Dyer <lsd@linuxgamers.net> ecore-0.0.2.ebuild :

  Ecore is the core event abstraction layer and X abstraction layer that makes
  doing selections, Xdnd, general X stuff, and event loops, timeouts and idle
  handlers fast, optimized, and convenient. it's a separate library so anyone
  can make use of the work put into Ecore to make this job easy for
  applications.
