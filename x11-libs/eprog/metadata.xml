Eprog is a convenience library for evas2, a canvas library written by Raster. It 
handles the creation of XFree86 toplevel windows that contain an evas, and takes 
care of feeding X events to the evas. Basically, it makes using Evas with XFree86 a 
whole lot easier.

In the words of raster, "eprog is an 'I just want to quickly write a custom canvas 
app and don't want to mess with setting up all the damn callbacks for everything 
myself' lib."

Note: Pretty much everything that eprog does (and a whole lot more) is now taken 
care of by the newest CVS (SPLIT) version of ecore (the ecore-evas module of ecore 
to be exact). So, eprog is pretty much obsolete. (Good for me, since I really don't 
have time to maintain anything these days). I'll still keep it available here, in 
case anyone is interested (and until I get around to rewriting the iconbar using the 
new ecore -- probably sometime this summer).
