*xforms-1.0_rc4 (28 Jul 2002)

  15 Aug 2002; Jack Morgan <jmorgan@gentoo.org> xforms-1.0_rc4.ebuild  :
  Added sparc64 to keywords

*xforms-1.0_rc4 (28 Jul 2002)

  28 Jul 2002; Owen Stampflee <owen@gentoo.org> xforms-1.0_rc4.ebuild
  files/digest-xforms-1.0_rc4 :

  XForms has been GPL'ed and here it is. 

*xforms-089-r3 (21 Jul 2002)

  21 Jul 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seeamnt@gentoo.org> xforms-089-r3.ebuild
  files/digest-xforms-089-r3 :

  This package has now been split into: xforms-x86 xforms-ppc and
  xforms-sparc (sparc64 as yet unknown).  Each of those contain KEYWORDS
  masking and PROVIDEs a virtual/xforms (which plain xforms RDEPENDs on).
  This should sort out a LOT of issues.


*xforms-089-r2 (19 June 2002)

  15 Jul 2002; Mark Guertin <gerk@gentoo.org>
  Added ppc to keywords

  15 July 2002; Owen Stampflee <owen@gentoo.org>
  Added missing digests for the PPC variant of the xforms digest.
  

  7 June 2002; Felix Kurth <felix@fkurth.de>
  
  Updated to -r2 because of missing fdesign and fd2ps needed for app development.  
  
*xforms-089-r1 (7 June 2002)

  7 June 2002; Mark Guertin <gerk@gentoo.org>
  
  Updated to -r1 for ppc compatability.  Vendor supplies speperate ppc sources
  with the exact same filename as x86 sources.  Strange workarounds needed.

*xforms-089 (1 Feb 2002)

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
  
  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
