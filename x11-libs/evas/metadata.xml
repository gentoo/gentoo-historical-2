Evas is a hardware-accelerated canvas API for X-Windows that can draw 
anti-aliased text, smooth super and sub-sampled images, alpha-blend, as well as 
drop down to using normal X11 primitives such as pixmaps, lines and rectangles 
for speed if your CPU or graphics hardware are too slow.

Evas abstracts any need to know much about what the characteristics of your 
XServer's display are, what depth or what magic visuals etc, it has. The most you 
need to tell Evas is how many colors (at a maximum) to use if the display is not 
a truecolor display. By default it is suggested to use 216 colors (as this 
equates to a 6x6x6 color cube - exactly the same color cube Netscape, Mozilla, 
gdkrgb etc. use so colors will be shared). If Evas can't allocate enough colors 
it keeps reducing the size of the color cube until it reaches plain black and 
white. This way, it can display on anything from a black and white only terminal 
to 16 color VGA to 256 color and all the way up through 15, 16, 24 and 32bit 
color.
