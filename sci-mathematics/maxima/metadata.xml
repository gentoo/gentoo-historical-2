    Computer Algebra system, descendent of Macsyma.
    Maxima is a system for the manipulation of symbolic and 
    numerical expressions, including differentiation, integration, 
    Taylor series, Laplace transforms, ordinary differential 
    equations, systems of linear equations, and vectors, matrices, 
    and tensors. Maxima produces high precision results by using 
    exact fractions and arbitrarily long floating point representations, 
    and can plot functions and data in two and three dimensions.
