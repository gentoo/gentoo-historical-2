FreeMat is a free environment for rapid engineering and scientific prototyping
and data processing. It is similar to commercial systems such as MATLAB from Mathworks,
and IDL from Research Systems, but is Open Source. FreeMat includes several
novel features such as a codeless interface to external C/C++/FORTRAN code,
parallel/distributed algorithm development (via MPI), and plotting
and visualization capabilities.
