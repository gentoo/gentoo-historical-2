  The software tools in the Chipmunk system perform a wide variety of tasks:
  electronic circuit simulation and schematic capture, graphics editing, and
  curve plotting, to name a few. Here is a brief description of each of the
  Chipmunk tools. Log is a graphical environment for entering circuit
  schematics, and for analog and digital circuit simulation. View is a tool for
  manipulating and plotting data. Until is a graphics editor. Wol is a tool for
  creating integrated circuit layout. In addition to these major tools, many
