		gattrib reads a set of gschem .sch files (schematic files), and creates a
		spreadsheet showing all components in rows, with the associated
		component attributes listed in the columns. It allows the user to add,
		modify, or delete component attributes outside of gschem, and then save
		the .sch files back out. When it is completed, it will allow the user to
		edit attributes attached to components, nets, and pins. Currently, only
		component attribute editing is implemented, pin attributes are displayed
		only, and net attributes are TBD.
