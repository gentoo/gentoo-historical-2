  Qucs is a Qt based integrated circuit simulator. It allows you to set up a
  circuit with a graphical user interface and simulate the large-signal,
  small-signal and noise behaviour of the circuit. The simulation results can
  then be viewed graphically. Qucsator is made available as a command line
  simulation backend.
