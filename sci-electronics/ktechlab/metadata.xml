  KTechlab provides a powerful environment for electronic circuits and
  microcontrollers. This includes simulation of a variety of components (logic,
  integrated, linear, nonlinear and reactive), simulation and debugging of PIC
  microcontrollers via gpsim, and its own closely-linked and complementary high
  level languages: FlowCode and Microbe.
