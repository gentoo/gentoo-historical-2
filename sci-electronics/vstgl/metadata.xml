  This application is intended to improve the overall design flow for people who
  are often working with Signal Transition Graphs (STG). From our own experience
  designing control circuits using the STG model, we recognized the need for a
  tool that could streamline the path from initial idea to final circuit
  specification. Usually people working in this field also depend heavily on
  Petrify.
