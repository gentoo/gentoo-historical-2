       Step A - Download the most recent online License data from the
                        Alias|Wavefront External Web

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

To obtain license data more recent than the information included on the
software CD, follow these instructions to obtain it from our web site.

  1. Go to the following URL to download the latest encrypted license file
     http://www.aliaswavefront.com/en/Community/Special/keys/m45pkeys/
  2. Save the file in a directory of your choice. Remember the location of
     the downloaded file as you will need it in the following instructions.
  3. Log in as root.
  4. Launch the installKey program located in the LicenseMaya directory on
     this CD. To launch the program type:
          ./installKey
  5. Use the browse button to the right of the Input file form and specify
     the location of the downloaded Alias|Wavefront license file explained
     above in point #1.
  6. If your organization uses a non-default filename for the license file,
     click the Advanced button to specify the path and filename. The default
     filenames for the license files are:
          /var/flexlm/aw.dat - for node-locked licenses
          /var/flexlm/aw_servername.dat - for floating licenses
  7. Click Install.

     If your license successfully installed, a message appears telling you
     the license was installed. You have completed the licensing portion.
     If your license was not successfully installed and a message appears
     stating no licenses were installed, go to Step B below.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

            Step B - Obtaining your license from Alias|Wavefront

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

To obtain your license, you must send a request to Alias|Wavefront with your
machine information and the products you wish to license. Follow these
instructions for each node-locked or license server machine.

  1. To obtain your license, you must include your computers unique identifier
     number. You obtain this by running the lmhostid command which is installed
     with Maya in the AWCommon-5.3-3 package.

     For Example:

     /usr/aw/COM/bin/lmhostid -ether  

     This will return a line of output something like the following:

     The FLEXlm host ID of this machine is "00c05fa6670f"

    The number between the quotes in the last field is the number that we need.
    In this example that number is 00c05fa6670f for your machine it will be a
    similar but different number. 
    
  2. On any browser (it does not need to be the same machine), access and complete
     the online SPAR (Software Product Authorization Request) form at:
	http://www.aliaswavefront.com/spar/
     OR
	Complete the printed SPAR form that comes with your softwares shipment
	and fax it to one of the offices listed on the form. Alias|Wavefront will
	process your request and provide you with the licenses by fax, email or mail
	as specified.

  3. Once you have received your license from Alias|Wavefront, see below for
     instructions on installing your license.
