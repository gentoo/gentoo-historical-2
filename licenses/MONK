MonK is my personal copyrighted software, but, it's free, which means

	anyone can use, copy, modify, or redistribute it,
	AT HIS/HER OWN RISK, WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY,

because of

	THE FACT THAT I PUT IT ON MY WEB PAGE,
	NOT BECAUSE OF THE 20TH CENTURY'S NASTY `LICENSES'

MonK is my personal copyrighted software, because

	I have written that,
	like I write sheet music,
	and,
	
	THAT SORT OF `ART' DOES NOT BELONG TO THE `SOCIETY' BUT TO A PERSON.

	Japanese domestic law assures that once someone has written those
	sort of art, at the moment, the copyright yields automatically
	without any procedure, and nobody can deprive it, or even the
	authour can't abandon it, because the copyright is casted into
	his/her personal right and cannot be split.  Quite making sense.

The early draft of monk.el had comments at the top of it, which run:

;; anyone can use, copy, modify, redistribute this software, at
;; his/her OWN RISK WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY, on the condition that he/she should
;;   1) use totally different name if redistribution as package is desired,
;;   2) record info such as who-did-what-stuff on modification adequately,
;;   3) any other stuff should be dealed just with decency and good intention.
;; The authour hopes that the MonK would be treated just like sheet music.

These are still my hope, but now I found out that anyone can do anything
once I put it on my public web page, even if I am hoping anything.
	
That is the freeness of the software in 21st century.

All the old LICENSES and COPYINGS from '80 written in nasty words must be perished
It doesn't do even any harm, but just being no use.  It's just disgusting.

IF ANYTHING WHICH SHOULD BE FREE IS WRITTEN, JUST PUT IT ON THE NET, BEFORE
ARGUING SISSY ABOUT `LICENCES' LIKE THIS.  THE WORLD KNOWS THAT STILL IT'S YOURS.

LET'S BRING SOFTWARES BACK TO AUTHOURS FROM THE GODDAMN `SOCIETY'.

Delete files condome.1 and sex.6 before firing up MonK,
because it's just very sad -- they ain't even immoral.
