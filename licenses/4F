<H1>SECTION ONE: The software under the 4F License</H1>
<DL>
<DT>Name of the Software Product<DD>uPM - Micro Package Manager
<DT>Short Description<DD>uPM is a package management system with source build and archive maintenance capability
<DT>License Holder<DD>Lameter International Corporation, 7131 Cabernet Ave, Newark, CA 94560, http://lameter.com info@lameter.com
<DT>Distribution License<DD>4F Class D
</DL>
<H1>SECTION TWO: The 4F License</H1>
<P>The aim of this license is not to restrict your rights. <i>4F Licensing</i> was developed to preserve the four freedoms when using a software product:
</P>
<OL>
<LI>The freedom to obtain and review the source code for the software product. The <i>4F license</i> requires that the source be made
available for software products distributed under 4F licenses.
<LI>The freedom to redistribute the source code and the binary. The <i>4F license</i> gives anyone the right to redistribute
the source as well as the binaries.
<LI>The freedom to modify the source code and redistribute the modifications.
<LI>The freedom to use software for any purpose by any person.
</OL>
<P><i>4F Licensing</i> protects your and other persons rights to make use of these freedoms.
Redistribution is only allowed if the person you are distributing to will also have the Four Freedoms.
A 4F License becomes invalid if those rights are not given. And this license is the only legal justification for the
use, modification and deployment of this software.
</P>
<P>We have chosen not to use the typical terms <b>Free Software</b> or <b>Open Source Software</b>
because both terms have led to a wrong understanding of this type of licensing in the past.
The concern of free or open source licensing is <b>not</b> to get the software for free
(meaning one does not have to pay any money for it) but to preserve the Four Freedoms.
The term <b>Free Software</b> typically leads to that misunderstanding.
The term <b>Open Source</b> often seems to avoid mentioning the Four Freedoms that need to be preserved.
It also gives rise to the misunderstanding that the access and ability to view the source code is sufficient.
<P>
We have chosen the term 4F (long <i>Four Freedoms</i>) because it does not have the baggage of the other terms
and clearly expresses the purpose of <i>Free</i> or <i>Open Source</i> Licenses.
<P>
<i>4F Licensing</i> allows different grades
of protection of these rights. If a <i>4F licensed</i> product is combined with other products the four freedoms might no
longer be applicable to the whole. <i>4F licensing</i> defines CLASSES of protection. A later class requires that the requirements of all earlier classes be fulfilled too. The following classes exist:
<TABLE BORDER=1>
<TR><TH>Class</TH><TH>Description</TH></TR>
<TR><TD>A</TD><TD><B>No protection</B>.
The sourcecode might be modified and redistributed under other licenses at will.
4F Class A licenses are similar to BSD licensed code.
The only provision is that credit is given to the authors of the code in the final product.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>B</TD><TD><B>Protection for the software product itself</B>.
The Four Freedoms must be preserved for all modifications of the source code that are distributed.
The product might be combined (f.e. linked into) other software that is licensed differently.
The combination of other software plus the software product might not preserve the Four Freedoms.
Class B licensing is similar to the protection offered by the LGPL.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>C</TD><TD><B>Program (Executable) protection</B>.
The Four Freedoms must be preserved for all binaries generated.
If a piece of software is used for the generation of a binary
then all sourcecode that was used to generate the binary and all shared
objects loaded must also be made available under the Four Freedoms.
If this is not possible then the combination or the production
of the binary is not permitted under this license.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>D</TD><TD><B>Media / Site protection.</B>.
The software might not be distributed on media combined with software not preserving
the four freedoms. This means that publication on a CD that contains non 4F compliant software is not
permitted. The medium and all content must be sharable under the Four Freedoms principle.
The same is true for publication of ftp sites.
Publication on ftp sites that also distribute non 4F compliant software is not permitted.
CDs and ftp site contents must be freely redistributable and modifiable in order to satisfy Class D.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>E</TD><TD><B>System protection.</B>.
The Four Freedoms must be preserved for all software installed under the same Operating System and all software
used to install the system and any software on it.
The license becomes invalid if software is present under the installation
with the same operating system that contain software not conformant to 4F licensing.
Specifically this prohibits installation of proprietary software (such as Microsoft Software) under the same installed
operating system as a Class E product.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>F</TD><TD><B>Organizational protection</B>. The software might not be used by an organization/group/corporation that
is combining the use of the software so licensed with software that does not provide the Four Freedoms.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>G</TD><TD><B>Protection for program interaction</B>. The software must be deployed in such a way that it does not interact (transfer data to/from, use documents formatted by) non 4F compliant software.</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
4F licensing aims to be conforming to the DFSG (Debian Free Software Guidelines http://www.debian.org), the OSI criteria
for free software licenses (Open Source Initiative see http://www.opensource.org) and the free software criteria of the
Free Software Foundation (The GNU project see http://www.gnu.org).
Only Classes A-C are compliant with the criteria of the those organizations since protection against loss of the Four Freedoms by aggregation is only permitted for binaries.
</P>
<H1>SECTION THREE: Warranty</H1>
<P>
The software is provided and licensed free of charge therefore there is no 
warranty for the software to the extent permitted by applicable law.

<H1>SECTION FOUR: Liability</H1>
<P>

copyright holder, or any other party who may have modified and/or redistributed
the software under the regulations of this license be liable to you for damages
including any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising out
of the use or inability to use the software (including but not limited to loss
of data or data being rendered inaccurate or losses sustained by the user or

if such holder or other party has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

<H1>SECTION FIVE: Definition of Terms</H1>
<P>
<DL>
<DT>4F Conformant License<DD>
A conformant license is a license that is conformant to the Free Software/Open Source principles.
OSI accredited licenses (see http://www.opensource.org) are
4F conformant. So is any license that allows the exercise 
of the Four Freedoms. Examples of conformant licenses are:
<UL>
<LI>4F Licenses
<LI>GPL	(is a 4F Class C compliant license)
<LI>LGPL (is a 4F Class B compliant license)
<LI>BSD	(is a 4F Class A compliant license)
<LI>Public Domain (is 4F Class A compliant)
</UL>
