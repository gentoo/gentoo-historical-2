LAPACK is a freely available software package provided on the World Wide Web

LAPACK.

Like all software, this package is copyrighted.  It is 
not trademarked; however,
if modifications are made that affect the
interface, functionality, or accuracy of the resulting software,
the name of the routine should be changed.  Any modification to our software
should be noted in the modifier's documentation.

We will gladly answer questions regarding our software.
If modifications are made to the software, however, it is the
responsibility of the individuals/company who modified the routine
to provide support.
