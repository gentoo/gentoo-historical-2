# There was some DFSG license debate about MESA in the past, on
# Debian bug 131997. This was primarily as the original license body
# did not provide the right to modify. Marc Kilgard, the upstream
# author, ultimately clarified this on the Debian bug:
# http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=131997#71
# Reproduced here below for reference.
