The normal process of generating licenses for modular X packages is to run
through all source files in an editor and copy all the copyright/license info
into the license file.  However, in the case of kdrive, there are almost
1000 source files.  We're not paid enough to do that much work in a short
period of time. ;)

An approximation of the licenses is stated in the ebuild.
