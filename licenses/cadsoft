Freeware License

The "Freeware" version of EAGLE Light is limited to "non-profit" or
evaluation use. By "non-profit" we mean that as soon as you earn money
by using EAGLE, you have to register it! This allows anybody who wishes
to use EAGLE Light for their private hobby projects to do so. Also students
can use this version for any educational projects. It is even ok to use this
version in a commercial environment as long as you just want to evaluate the
program. As soon as you start using it for commercial projects, you will
have to register it.

This particular license is valid without a printed "User License Certificate".
