FastIO ClibPDF Software License Agreement
(Version 1.30, January 27, 2000) 0. SUBJECT MATTER. This is a license agreement between FastIO Systems, Inc. (hereinafter referred to as the "Licensor") and _________________________________ (hereinafter referred to as the "Licensee") in which Licensor grants Licensee certain rights in the software known as "FastIO ClibPDF Library." The "Program", as used below, refers to the current release version of such program at the time of this agreement. The Program is copyrighted work, and its title and copyright are held by Licensor. BY USING, MODIFYING OR DISTRIBUTING THE PROGRAM OR ANY LARGER WORK THAT IS BASED ON THE PROGRAM, YOU INDICATE YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THIS LICENSE, AND ALL ITS TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTING OR MODIFYING THE PROGRAM OR PRODUCING LARGER WORK BASED ON IT. NOTHING OTHER THAN THIS LICENSE GRANTS YOU PERMISSION TO MODIFY OR DISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM OR ITS DERIVATIVE WORKS. IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, DO NOT USE THE PROGRAM IN ANY FORM OR MANNER. COMMERCIAL USERS MUST ADDITIONALLY EXECUTE THE AGREEMENT WITH AUTHORIZED SIGNATURES. 1. DEFINITIONS. 1.1. "Source Code" means a collection of files for the Program in forms that are used for originally creating it or making modifications to it, including all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, scripts and files containing development environment settings used to control compilation and installation of an Executable, or a list of differential comparisons between different versions of it. 1.2. "Executable" means the Program in any form other than source code. 1.3. "Larger Work" or "Derivative Work" means any work which combines the Program or portions thereof with code not governed by the terms of this License. 1.4. "You" means the Licensee, an individual or a legal entity exercising rights under, and complying with all of the terms of, this License or a future version of this License issued under Section 7.1. For legal entities, "you" includes any entity which controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with you. 1.5 "Use" means an act of copying, editing, modifying, incorporating, distributing, and executing (or running) the Program or a subset thereof, or any Larger Work. A Use of the Program or its subset or any Larger Work in an application program or any Executable is defined as having these programs make application programming interface (API) calls in any Larger Work to the Program or any portion of it in any form, regardless of whether the Program or any portion of it is complied and included in the Executable, or the Program as a whole or any part thereof or the Larger Work Page 1 of 9


reside in a shared library, loadable module, or dynamic link library (DLL), and regardless of whether the application programs and the Program run on the same central processing unit (CPU) or on separate CPUs via bus, interconnection, or network. Whether the shared library, loadable module, or DLL containing any portion or form of the Program has been obtained separately from users exempt from Commercial Use license fees is irrelevant to the determination of Commercial Use status of an application program. Calling wrapper or stub functions to ClibPDF functions under different groupings or names is still considered as the use of the API. 1.6 "Commercial Use" means any Use, as defined in section 1.5, of the Program or Larger Work for which any payment, profit or financial gain is sought directly or indirectly, regardless of whether the payment or gain is actually realized, and regardless of whether it is realized immediately or in the future (or in the past, if it is possible). The following examples are considered as instances of Commercial Use (This is not an exhaustive enumeration): (a) Use of the Program or any Larger Work in any application programs, modules or plug-ins, shared libraries, loadable modules, dynamic link libraries (DLLs) that are sold or licensed commercially in accordance with the definition of Commercial Use as defined in Section 1.6 of this License. (b) Deployment of the Program or any Larger Work on a Internet or Intranet for server-side applications including, but not limited to, Commercial Uses as a part of World Wide Web services, or as a downloadable plug-in or applets in Web browser or any client application. (c) Use of the Program or any Larger Work in an application program used in any business-related activities, including but not limited to industrial or laboratory testing, production or process control, product research and development, factory automation, quality and inventory control, report generation, production planning and executive or any level of decision making. 1.7 "Payment" (that you receive in the context of Commercial Use) means any form of monetary payment, securities and certificates of deposits, rights to exercise options for future financial gain, payment in employee or any form of benefits, promise or delivery of services, settlements of legal or commercial disputes, tangible materials and anything or right of financial value now or in the future. Direct payments include, but are not limited to, a payment for a copy of the Program or Larger Work, or for services or acts of using, modifying, developing or deploying the Program or Larger Work. Indirect payments include, but are not limited to, inclusion of the Program or Larger Work as a "no charge" or free "bundled" item in connection with services or product for which a payment is made. For the purpose of this License, a single instance of Commercial Use for a product or a service classifies the entire use for that product or service as Commercial Use, even if all other instances of uses are offered free of charge. 1.8 "License Fee" shall mean a one-time non-refundable fee payable to the Licensor in consideration for the Use of the Program (check items applicable): ___ ___ a) Use in Single End-User Product or Application b) Web Serving Single IP Address $1,000 $1,000

c) Server-side Application License $5,000 d) Unlimited Corporate-wide License $5,000 e) Unlimited Server-side Application License $15,000 f) Unlimited Multi-national World-wide Corporate License $25,000 g) Inclusion in a commercial software development environment/library <please contact us>

If a) or b), list the product name or IP number/server hostname below: ______________________________________________________________________. A Corporate-wide License applies to one incorporated unit and does not extend to subsidiaries. Corporations whose stocks are issued or traded separately are considered separate corporations by definition, and therefore cannot share a Corporate-wide license. Multi-national World-wide Corporate License covers groups of companies that are majority owned (ownership of more than 50%) by Licensee. A Server-side application license allows Licensee to Use the Program in any number of serverside applications and distribute them in unlimited manner. Licensee, at its option, may elect to upgrade the License to a new version of the Program (the Upgrade Payment) at an additional fee, if more than two (2) years have elapsed from the date of this agreement or after the date of delivery of paid upgrades thereafter. Licensee is entitled to upgrades without charge, if and when they become available, for a duration of two years from the date of this agreement or after the date of delivery of paid upgrades thereafter. Availability, schedule and pricing of updates to the Program is solely determined by Licensor, and Licensor is not obligated to release updates for the Program. If you do not wish to upgrade, you may continue to Use the version of the Program obtained under a valid license in perpetuity. License Fee is non-refundable under any circumstance, even if Use ceases for any reason for a product, application, discontinuation of web servers, or due to corporate mergers or a termination of corporation. However, the License may be transferred to another product or Web server if the Use do not overlap within the Licensee organization. 1.9 "Single Product" means a product sold or licensed under a common principal product name. Individual programs in a "suite" or a "bundle" of applications are considered separate products unless they are always distributed as a single entity and no instances exist where they are distributed, sold or licensed separately. However, different versions of the same product, for example, "WordProcessor Plain" and "WordProcessor Pro," are considered as a Single Product. 1.10 "End-User Product" is software or application that is not capable of being used for developing or producing new applications that are Larger Work or Derivative Work. 2. LICENSES. Licensor hereby grants Licensee a non-exclusive world-wide perpetual license to Use the Program, provided that Commercial License Fee as set forth in section 1.8 has been paid if

applicable, and subject to third party intellectual property claims, and provided that you comply with all of the conditions set forth in this License. 2.1 You may copy and distribute literal (i.e., verbatim) copies of the Program's source code, documentation, and this License as you receive it throughout the world, in any medium. 2.2 You may Use the Program, create Larger Work based on the Program and distribute copies of such throughout the world, in any medium. 3. CONDITIONS. This License is subject to the following conditions: 3.1 The Source Code or compiled library (static, shared, or dynamic link or DLL) version of the Program, modified or unmodified, may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 7.1, and you must include a copy of this License (LICENSE.pdf) with every copy of the Source Code or compiled library you distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code or compiled library version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. If the Program is embeded in an end-user application in the form that is not useable from any other application, it is not necessary to include a copy of this License. 3.2 You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices indicating that you have modified the files and the date of change. 3.3 If you received the Program or Larger Work from any party and you Use it to produce or develop further Derivative Work under Commercial Use, you must obtain a commercial license from FastIO Systems, Inc. 3.4 You must disclose any knowledge of intellectual property rights relevant to the modifications and additions as set forth in Section 6. 3.5 The Licensor, at his option, is entitled to incorporate modifications and additions to the Program to upgrade the Program that the Licensor distributes without any need for permission or any obligation (other than a moral obligation to acknowledge in relevant source files) if the modified source code is sent to the Licensor or is distributed via a generally accessible medium, including but not limited to mailing lists, Usenet News, Web and FTP sites, CDROMs and any other medium. However, you are not obligated to release or distribute modified source code of the Program or source code to any Larger Work. 3.6 You may not modify the binary data on the second line (after the %PDF-n.n line) of the PDF files created by the Program or any Larger Work. 3.7 You may not modify the data enclosed by [ ] (and including [ ] themselves) in the /Producer field of the Info dictionary of the generated PDF files. However, you may append any additional information to the /Producer string.

EXEMPTIONS AND DEFERMENT OF COMMERCIAL LICENSE FEE. Exempt users listed herein are not required to send the signed license agreement to the Licensor. However, you are still bound by all applicable conditions and requirements as set forth in this License. 5.1 Non-Profit Organization Exemption Uses, modifications, distributions, or deployments of the Program or Larger Work by educational institutions, non-profit organizations, and governments are exempt from Commercial Use license fees. Uses by consultants, contractors to non-profit organizations are exempt under this provision if the Use of the Program or Larger Work is solely in projects for these non-profit organizations and the rights to the resulting work including the source code belong to the nonprofit organization. If the contractors or consultants retain the rights to the resulting work including rights to sell or use the resulting work elsewhere, the exemption does not apply. 5.2 Private Non-Profit User Exemption Non-profit uses, modifications, and distributions of the Program or Larger Work by a private individual are exempt from Commercial Use license fees. An example of use that does not fall under this exemption is the for-profit uses by individuals, such as in consulting or private business practices. 5.3 End-User Exemption Executing (running) a program or application that incorporates the Program or Larger Work is exempt from License Fee if you have obtained the Program or Larger Work in binary executable form only, and you do not own, control the rights to, or Use any portion of the source code of the

Page 5 of 9


Larger Work or any portion of the source code that makes API calls to the Program or Larger Work. 5.4 Shareware Developer Deferment Commercial Use in shareware applications that use the Program or any Larger Work is exempt from license fees until the cumulative total gross receipt of payments for all of your shareware applications that Use the Program exceeds ten (10) times the Commercial Use license fee for the Program. Thereafter, the shareware applications enjoy no special status and you must obtain Commercial Use license from the Licensor. 5.5 Commercial Users are granted an automatic one-time examination license for the period of 30 days. After this period, you must obtain a Commercial Use license from the Licensor. 5.6 Posting the Program on a public access information storage and retrieval service for which a fee is received for retrieving information (such as an on-line service, an Internet service provider or a portal) is not considered a Commercial Use, provided that the fee is not content-dependent (i.e., the fee would be the same for retrieving the same volume of information consisting of random data) and that access to the service and to the Program is available independent of any other product or service. An example of a service that does not fall under this section is an on-line service that is operated by a company and that is only available to customers of that company. (This is not an exhaustive enumeration.) 5.7 Distributing the Program on removable computer-readable media, provided that the files containing the Program are reproduced entirely and verbatim on such media, that all information on such media be redistributable for non-commercial purposes without charge, and that such media are distributed by themselves (except for accompanying documentation) independent of any other product or service. Examples of such media include CD-ROM, magnetic tape, and optical storage media. (This is not intended to be an exhaustive list.) An example of a distribution that does not fall under this section is a CD-ROM included in a book or magazine. (This is not an exhaustive enumeration.) 6. INTELLECTURAL PROPERTY MATTERS 6.1 Third Party Claims. If You have knowledge that a party claims an intellectual property right in particular functionality or code (or its utilization under this License), you must include a text file with the source code or Executable distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. The LEGAL file must be prominently visible by any file or directory viewer and file listing commands, and reside in the same prominently visible directory or folder containing this License. If you obtain such knowledge after you make your modification or Larger Work available to others, You shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies you make available thereafter, notify FastIO Systems in writing or e-mail (fastio@fastio.com) and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Program that new knowledge has been obtained.

6.2 Patented API, technology and algorithm. If your modification or Larger Work includes an application programming interface (API), technology or algorithm, and you own or control patents which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, technology or algorithm, you must also include this information in the LEGAL file. 7.
