   1. LICENSE DEFINITIONS:
         1. "Materials" are defined as the software, documentation, license key 
codes and other materials, including any updates and upgrade thereto, that are 
provided to you under this Agreement. Materials also include the 
Redistributables as defined below.
         2. "Redistributables" are the files listed in the "redist.txt" file 
that is included in the Materials. If there is no redist.txt file included in 
the Materials, then there are no Redistributables.
   2. LICENSE GRANT:
         1. Subject to all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Intel 
Corporation ("Intel") grants to you a non-exclusive, non-assignable, copyright 
license to use the Materials.
         2. Subject to all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Intel 
grants to you a non-exclusive, non-assignable copyright license to modify the 
Materials, or any portions thereof, that are (i) provided in source code form 
or, (ii) are defined as Redistributables and are provided in text form.
         3. Subject to all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Intel 
grants to you a non-exclusive, non-assignable copyright license to distribute 
(except under an Evaluation License as specified below) the Redistributables,
