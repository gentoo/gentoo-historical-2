END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT

1. GRANT OF LICENSE. The software programs you are installing, downloading, or have acquired with this 
Agreement, including any updates, modifications, revisions, copies, and documentation (“Software”) 
are copyrighted, trade secret and confidential information of Mentor Graphics or its licensors who maintain 
exclusive title to all Software and retain all rights not expressly granted by this Agreement. Mentor 
Graphics or its authorized distributor grants to you, subject to payment of appropriate license fees, a 
nontransferable, nonexclusive license to use Software solely: (a) in machine-readable, object-code form; 
(b) for your internal business purposes; and (c) on the computer hardware or at the site for which an 
applicable license fee is paid, or as authorized by Mentor Graphics. A site is restricted to a one-half 
mile (800 meter) radius. Mentor Graphics’ then-current standard policies, which vary depending on 
Software, license fees paid or service plan purchased, apply to the following and are subject to change: 
(a) relocation of Software; (b) use of Software, which may be limited, for example, to execution of a 
single session by a single user on the authorized hardware or for a restricted period of time (such 
limitations may be communicated and technically implemented through the use of authorization codes or 
similar devices); (c) eligibility to receive updates, modifications, and revisions; and (d) support 
services provided. Current standard policies are available upon request.

2. ESD SOFTWARE. If you purchased a license to use embedded software development (“ESD”) Software, 
Mentor Graphics or its authorized distributor grants to you a nontransferable, nonexclusive license to 
reproduce and distribute executable files created using ESD compilers, including the ESD run-time libraries 
distributed with ESD C and C++ compiler Software that are linked into a composite program as an integral 
part of your compiled computer program, provided that you distribute these files only in conjunction with 
your compiled computer program. Mentor Graphics does NOT grant you any right to duplicate or incorporate 
copies of Mentor Graphics' real-time operating systems or other ESD Software, except those explicitly 
granted in this section, into your products without first signing a separate agreement with Mentor Graphics 
for such purpose.

3. BETA CODE.
3.1 Portions or all of certain Software may contain code for experimental testing and evaluation (“Beta 
Code”), which may not be used without Mentor Graphics’ explicit authorization. Upon Mentor 
Graphics’ authorization, Mentor Graphics grants to you a temporary, nontransferable, nonexclusive 
license for experimental use to test and evaluate the Beta Code without charge for a limited period of time 
specified by Mentor Graphics. This grant and your use of the Beta Code shall not be construed as marketing 
or offering to sell a license to the Beta Code, which Mentor Graphics may choose not to release 
commercially in any form.
3.2 If Mentor Graphics authorizes you to use the Beta Code, you agree to evaluate and test the Beta Code 
under normal conditions as directed by Mentor Graphics. You will contact Mentor Graphics periodically 
during your use of the Beta Code to discuss any malfunctions or suggested improvements. Upon completion of 
your evaluation and testing, you will send to Mentor Graphics a written evaluation of the Beta Code, 
including its strengths, weaknesses and recommended improvements.
3.3 You agree that any written evaluations and all inventions, product improvements, modifications or 
developments that Mentor Graphics conceives or makes during or subsequent to this Agreement, including 
those based partly or wholly on your feedback, will be the exclusive property of Mentor Graphics. Mentor 
Graphics will have exclusive rights, title and interest in all such property. The provisions of this 
subsection shall survive termination or expiration of this Agreement.


4. RESTRICTIONS ON USE. You may copy Software only as reasonably necessary to support the authorized use. 
Each copy must include all notices and legends embedded in Software and affixed to its medium and container 
as received from Mentor Graphics. All copies shall remain the property of Mentor Graphics or its licensors. 
You shall maintain a record of the number and primary location of all copies of Software, including copies 
merged with other software, and shall make those records available to Mentor Graphics upon request. You 
shall not make Software available in any form to any person other than your employer's employees and 
contractors, excluding Mentor Graphics' competitors, whose job performance requires access. You shall take 
appropriate action to protect the confidentiality of Software and ensure that any person permitted access 
to Software does not disclose it or use it except as permitted by this Agreement. Except as otherwise 
permitted for purposes of interoperability as specified by the European Union Software Directive or local 
law, you shall not reverse-assemble, reverse-compile, reverse-engineer or in any way derive from Software 
any source code. You may not sublicense, assign or otherwise transfer Software, this Agreement or the 
rights under it without Mentor Graphics’ prior written consent. The provisions of this section shall 
survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement.

5. LIMITED WARRANTY.
5.1 Mentor Graphics warrants that during the warranty period Software, when properly installed, will 
substantially conform to the functional specifications set forth in the applicable user manual. Mentor 
Graphics does not warrant that Software will meet your requirements or that operation of Software will be 
uninterrupted or error free. The warranty period is 90 days starting on the 15th day after delivery or upon 
installation, whichever first occurs. You must notify Mentor Graphics in writing of any nonconformity 
within the warranty period. This warranty shall not be valid if Software has been subject to misuse, 
unauthorized modification or installation. MENTOR GRAPHICS' ENTIRE LIABILITY AND YOUR EXCLUSIVE REMEDY 
SHALL BE, AT MENTOR GRAPHICS' OPTION, EITHER (A) REFUND OF THE PRICE PAID UPON RETURN OF SOFTWARE TO MENTOR 
GRAPHICS OR (B) MODIFICATION OR REPLACEMENT OF SOFTWARE THAT DOES NOT MEET THIS LIMITED WARRANTY, PROVIDED 
YOU HAVE OTHERWISE COMPLIED WITH THIS AGREEMENT. MENTOR GRAPHICS MAKES NO WARRANTIES WITH RESPECT TO: (A) 
SERVICES; (B) SOFTWARE WHICH IS LOANED TO YOU FOR A LIMITED TERM OR AT NO COST; OR (C) EXPERIMENTAL BETA 
CODE; ALL OF WHICH ARE PROVIDED “AS IS.”
5.2 THE WARRANTIES SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION 5 ARE EXCLUSIVE. NEITHER MENTOR GRAPHICS NOR ITS LICENSORS 
MAKE ANY OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO SOFTWARE OR OTHER MATERIAL PROVIDED UNDER 
THIS AGREEMENT. MENTOR GRAPHICS AND ITS LICENSORS SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIM ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF 
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.


6. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. EXCEPT WHERE THIS EXCLUSION OR RESTRICTION OF LIABILITY WOULD BE VOID OR 
INEFFECTIVE UNDER APPLICABLE STATUTE OR REGULATION, IN NO EVENT SHALL MENTOR GRAPHICS OR ITS LICENSORS BE 
LIABLE FOR INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING LOST PROFITS OR SAVINGS) 
WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, EVEN IF MENTOR GRAPHICS OR ITS LICENSORS HAVE 
BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT SHALL MENTOR GRAPHICS' OR ITS LICENSORS' 
LIABILITY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED THE AMOUNT PAID BY YOU FOR THE SOFTWARE OR SERVICE GIVING RISE TO THE 
CLAIM. IN THE CASE WHERE NO AMOUNT WAS PAID, MENTOR GRAPHICS AND ITS LICENSORS SHALL HAVE NO LIABILITY FOR 
ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER.

7. LIFE ENDANGERING ACTIVITIES. NEITHER MENTOR GRAPHICS NOR ITS LICENSORS SHALL BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES 
RESULTING FROM OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE OF SOFTWARE IN ANY APPLICATION WHERE THE FAILURE OR INACCURACY 
OF THE SOFTWARE MIGHT RESULT IN DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY. YOU AGREE TO INDEMNIFY AND HOLD HARMLESS MENTOR 
GRAPHICS AND ITS LICENSORS FROM ANY CLAIMS, LOSS, COST, DAMAGE, EXPENSE, OR LIABILITY, INCLUDING ATTORNEYS' 
FEES, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH USE.

8. INFRINGEMENT.
8.1 Mentor Graphics will defend or settle, at its option and expense, any action brought against you 
alleging that Software infringes a patent or copyright in the United States, Canada, Japan, Switzerland, 
Norway, Israel, Egypt, or the European Union. Mentor Graphics will pay any costs and damages finally 
awarded against you that are attributable to the claim, provided that you: (a) notify Mentor Graphics 
promptly in writing of the action; (b) provide Mentor Graphics all reasonable information and assistance to 
settle or defend the claim; and (c) grant Mentor Graphics sole authority and control of the defense or 
settlement of the claim.

8.2 If an infringement claim is made, Mentor Graphics may, at its option and expense, either (a) replace or 
modify Software so that it becomes noninfringing, or (b) procure for you the right to continue using 
Software. If Mentor Graphics determines that neither of those alternatives is financially practical or 
otherwise reasonably available, Mentor Graphics may require the return of Software and refund to you any 
license fee paid, less a reasonable allowance for use.
8.3 Mentor Graphics has no liability to you if the alleged infringement is based upon: (a) the combination 
of Software with any product not furnished by Mentor Graphics; (b) the modification of Software other than 
by Mentor Graphics; (c) the use of other than a current unaltered release of Software; (d) the use of 
Software as part of an infringing process; (e) a product that you design or market; (f) any Beta Code 
contained in Software; or (g) any Software provided by Mentor Graphics’ licensors which do not provide 
such indemnification to Mentor Graphics’ customers.
8.4 THIS SECTION 8 STATES THE ENTIRE LIABILITY OF MENTOR GRAPHICS AND ITS LICENSORS AND YOUR SOLE AND 
EXCLUSIVE REMEDY WITH RESPECT TO ANY ALLEGED PATENT OR COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT BY ANY SOFTWARE LICENSED 
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.

9. TERM. This Agreement remains effective until expiration or termination. This Agreement will

automatically expire at the end of the authorized term. Upon any termination or expiration, you agree to 
cease all use of Software and return it to Mentor Graphics or certify deletion and destruction of Software, 
including all copies, to Mentor Graphics’ reasonable satisfaction.

10. EXPORT. Software is subject to regulation by local laws and United States government agencies, which 
prohibit export or diversion of certain products, information about the products, and direct products of

local and United States government agencies.
