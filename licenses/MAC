   Non-legally Binding License Description

   The above license is designed to protect both me, and the Monkey's Audio
   project.  However, anyone who has ever been kind enough to request
   permission to use Monkey's Audio has been granted the right to do as they
   please, completely free of charge or royalty.  So, the license exists not
   to hinder what considerate people can do with Monkey's Audio, but instead
   to protect against the (hopefully few) inconsiderate people.

                                        

                                        

   All rights not expressly granted here are reserved by Matthew T. Ashland.
