The Offline NT Password & Registry Editor

Copyright information & credits for:
chntpw binary
chntpw source
ntreg source (registry edit library)
is Copyright (c) 1997-2004 Petter Nordahl-Hagen, pnordahl@eunet.no

Rules (someone calls it license):
The chntpw binary & source can be both changed and distributed 
by anyone in any way they like if:
1) No one makes money on it (commercial sales is a big NONO)
 except: a) Charging for media/packaging/printed docs/support/shipping
	    is allowed.
         b) Inclusion in typical linux, *bsd or similar OS
	    distributions (also commercial)
	    is allowed as long as use of chntpw & ntreg is
	    not the distributions primary purpose. Anyway it's
	    nice if I get notified any such inclusion.
2) The source must be available (at least as an option)
3) The changed program also follows these rules.
4) As long as code written by me is included, it must give me credit,
   at least in the source code and docs.

If you ask I will very likely allow other types of distribution.
(have already had questions of it as a bonus on eBay auctions.
 ask, and you will likely get permission)
I'm just a kind of control freak, so I want to know what's going on.
