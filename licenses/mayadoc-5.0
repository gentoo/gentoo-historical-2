embodiment, including copies thereof, and any other information or data, in 
written, graphic, or machine readable form, received by Customer from 
Alias|Wavefront, including, but not limited to, designs, improvements, concepts
and ideas provided, however, that Proprietary Material does not include 
information and data which is rightfully in Customer's possession prior to its 
receipt from Alias|Wavefront, or which, other than through the fault of 
Customer, is or becomes available in the public domain. Alias|Wavefront and/ 
retain all right, title, and interest in and to all Proprietary Material 
(including, without limitation, all trade secrets and intellectual property 
rights therein) furnished by Alias|Wavefront and to all copies thereof made by 
Customer.  Customer acknowledges that the Proprietary Material is confidential 
and constitutes a valuable asset of Alias|Wavefront and/or its suppliers and/or
its licensors and shall not disclose, publish, display or otherwise make 
available to any persons any of the Proprietary Material or copies thereof 
without Alias|Wavefront's prior written consent.  Customer shall not copy or

disclosure or use.  Customer shall not remove any copyright or proprietary 
rights notice included in any Proprietary Material and shall reproduce all such
notices on any copies made of any Proprietary Material.  Customer acknowledges 
and agrees that in the event of any breach of its obligations under this 
Section, Alias|Wavefront will not have an adequate remedy at law, and, 
therefore, injunctive or other equitable relief would be appropriate.

6. Term and Termination.  This Agreement is effective until terminated.   If

hereunder, Alias|Wavefront may terminate this Agreement and the license granted

time by destroying all copies of the Software in Customer's possession and 
certifying in writing such destruction to Alias|Wavefront, or by returning all 
such copies to Alias|Wavefront.  This Agreement and Customer's license and 
rights hereunder shall automatically terminate if Customer purports to assign 
this Agreement or the license granted hereunder to another party or breaches 
any of its obligations hereunder in respect of the Proprietary Material.  Upon 
termination, Customer must immediately cease all use of the Software and 
deliver or destroy all Proprietary Material, including copies thereof, in its 
possession, custody or control, including information and data relating to the 
Software stored in any computer software or storage facility which for any 
reason cannot be delivered to Alias|Wavefront or which may be detected in the

7. Government End Users-Restricted Rights Legend.  If the Software is acquired 
directly or indirectly on behalf of a unit or agency of the United States 
Government and this provision applies.  For civilian agencies: the 
Alias|Wavefront Software was developed at private expense and is "restricted 
computer software" submitted with restricted rights in accordance with 
subparagraphs (a) through (d) of the Commercial Computer Software - Restricted 
Rights clause of FAR 52.227-19 and its successors; and it is unpublished and 
all rights are reserved under the copyright laws of the United States.  For 
units of the Department of Defense (DoD): the Alias|Wavefront Software is 
licensed only with "Restricted Rights" as that term is defined in the DoD 
Supplement to the FAR, clause 252.227-7013 (c)(1)(ii) (Oct. 1988), Rights in 
Technical Data and Computer Software and its Successors (including clause 
252.227-7014(b)(3) (1994)), and use, duplication or disclosure is subject to

export control laws and regulations, including future amendments thereof 
("Export Laws").  Customer shall not directly or indirectly purport to or 
transfer the Software in any manner in violation of any Export Laws.  Customer 
shall indemnify Alias|Wavefront from and against any loss, claim or damage 
arising out of Customer's violation of the Export Laws.  All written notices 
required hereunder shall be sufficient if sent by certified or registered mail,
postage prepaid, addressed to the address provided by Customer prior to 
downloading the Software.  This Agreement sets forth the entire agreement and 
understanding of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and 
supersedes all prior oral and written agreements and understandings relating 
thereto. Neither party shall be bound by or be liable for any alleged 
representation, promise, inducement or statement of intention not set forth 
herein and no waiver, alteration, modification, or cancellation of any of the 
provisions of this Agreement shall be binding unless made in writing and signed
by the parties.   The failure of either party to require performance of any 
provision hereof shall not affect the right at a later time to enforce such 
provision.  No remedy referred to in this agreement is intended to be 
exclusive, but each shall be cumulative and in addition to any other remedy 
referred to herein or otherwise available at law or in equity.  In the event 
that one or more of the provisions contained in this Agreement shall for any 
reason be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, no other 
provisions contained in the Agreement shall be affected.  This Agreement shall 
be governed by the substantive law of the Province of Ontario, Canada, without 
regard to its conflicts of law principles, and not by the 1980 United Nations 
Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, as amended.  This 
Agreement shall be binding upon and enure to the benefit of the parties and 
their respective successors, assigns and legal representatives, provided, 
however, that the rights and obligations of Customer hereunder may not be 
assigned, sublicensed or otherwise transferred in whole or in part, without the
prior written consent of Alias|Wavefront.
