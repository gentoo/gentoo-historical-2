Clean License Conditions

Clean is available under a dual license: 
1 The LGPL the standard GNU Lesser General Open Source license (see below), 
which is free, but 
available for non-commercial purposes only. 
2 A commercial license (see below) that must be purchased. Information on that 
license can be obtained 
from Prof.dr.ir. M.J. Plasmeijer, preferably via email: rinus@cs.kun.nl.

Note, that development under the LGPL license entails some restrictions and 
responsibilities. More 
information on the nature of the LGPL is available at www.gnu.org and 
www.opensource.org. 
Users can choose which they wish to operate under. However, for commercial 
applications the 
LGPL license is not available. Instead, developers wishing to distribute 
commercial applications 
(either publicly or privately) must purchase a commercial license. 

Commercial purposes are those involving money (excluding the costs for 
distributing and copying): 
for example: 
- selling software that uses directly or indirectly the source code of the Clean 
system or 
portions thereof;
- selling services based on software that uses directly or indirectly the source 
code of the 
Clean system, or portions thereof;
- using software that uses directly or indirectly the source code of the Clean 
system, or 
portions thereof, to examine, manage, measure or report the performance of a 
business.

Warning
Developers who distribute commercial applications, either publicly or privately, 
that are written using 
the Clean system, who do not have a commercial license are in breach of these 
license conditions 
and of US and International copyright law. The penalties for such breaches are 
quite severe, and 
offenders will be prosecuted. 

Note
For a few parts of the Clean system the sources are not available yet. In 
particular, this concerns the 
alpha release of Sparkle. It is the intention that for 
these parts the sources 
will be available soon under these license conditions. For the time being, these 
parts of the Clean 
system are available under the old Clean license conditions (see below) only.

OLD Clean License Conditions
============================

The Concurrent Clean Compiler and the Concurrent Clean Program
Development System are developed by the Research Group on Functional
Programming Languages at the University of Nijmegen (copyright
University of Nijmegen, Hilt High Level Software Tools B.V. , 1987-2000).

The Clean Software can be used free of charge only if it is used for
non-profit purposes in a non-commercial environment, i.e. for
educational or research purposes in a non-profit institute or for
personal, non-commercial use. For this kind of use it is allowed to
copy the software under the condition that the complete distribution
(see the Clean Distribution page) for a certain platform is copied,
including this license condition, copyright notice, language manual,
help file, the compiler, the code generator and the development system.
Under the same conditions it is allowed to re-distribute the system. We
appreciate it very much if you would inform us when you copy or
redistribute the system.

For ANY use of Clean with a commercial purpose or in a commercial
environment a commercial license is needed.
