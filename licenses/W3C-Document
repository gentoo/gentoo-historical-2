   This formulation of W3C's notice and license became active on December
   31 2002. This version removes the copyright ownership notice such that
   this license can be used with materials other than those owned by the
   W3C, moves information on style sheets, DTDs, and schemas to the
   [8]Copyright FAQ, reflects that ERCIM is now a host of the W3C,
   includes references to this specific dated version of the license, and
   removes the ambiguous grant of "use". See the [9]older formulation for
   the policy prior to this date. Please see our [10]Copyright FAQ for
   common questions about using materials from our site, such as the
   translating or annotating specifications. Other questions about this
   notice can be directed to [11]site-policy@w3.org.
