*hcfpcimodem-0.99mbsibeta02123100 (02 Feb 2003)

  02 Feb 2003; Joshua Brindle <method@gentoo.org> : hcfpcimodem-0.99.02123100.ebuild
  Initial import.  
  Note that the "changed_file" listing is optional if you are simply bumping
  the rev of the ebuild and are only making changes to the .ebuild file
  itself.  Also note that we now have a single unified paragraph rather than
  having the first line separated from the rest by a newline.  Everything
  should be in one block like this. (note by drobbins, 16 Jul 2002)
