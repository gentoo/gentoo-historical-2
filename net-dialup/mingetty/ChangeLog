  ChangeLog files/digest-mingetty-1.00 :

  This is a minimal getty for virtual consoles only, as used by RedHat,
  Mandrake, etc.  The SRC_URI points to a src.rpm from Redhat, which is why
  rpm2targz was made a dependency of this.  Ebuild submission by:
  ian@abbott.org (Ian Abbott) in bug #7382.
