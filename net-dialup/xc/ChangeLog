*xc-4.3.2-r1 (16 Jan 2004)

  16 Jan 2004; Joshua Kinard <kumba@gentoo.org> xc-4.3.2-r1.ebuild,
  files/xc-4.3.2-add-115200.patch:
  Added a small patch which allows xc to use 115200 baud speed for serial port
  connections (I wanted to use this program to link into my cobalt raq2, which
  operates at such a speed, and minicom has issues). Also tweaked the Makefile
  to import CFLAGS from the portage environment.

*xc-4.3.2 (06 Sep 2002)

  01 Jul 2003; Joshua Kinard <kumba@gentoo.org> xc-4.3.2.ebuild:
  Fixed compile-time issue in which ${WARN} was somehow being called into the
  Makefile and killing the build by making all text turn yellow. Added a WARN=""
  to the make line in src_compile().  Closes Bug #23799.
  Also added ~sparc and ~mips to KEYWORDS

  23 May 2003; Chuck Brewer <killian@gentoo.org>:
  Added manifest.

  06 Sep 2002; Daniel Ahlberg <aliz@gentoo.org> :
  Initial import. xc is needed for xmodem transfers, found by Paul Ruhland <pruhland@rochester.rr.com>
  in bug #5943.
