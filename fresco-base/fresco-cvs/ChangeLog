*fresco-20021020.ebuild (20 Oct 2002)

  20 Oct 2002; phoen][x <phoenix@gentoo.org> fresco-cvs-20021006.ebuild 
  files/digest-fresco-cvs-20021006, files/gcc-3.2.patch.bz2, files/rundemo.sh :

  Initial import. This is the cvs ebuild for fresco. Fresco is far from
  finished, so it makes definitely no sense to have a static ebuild for 
  it yet. This ebuild features a gcc3.2 patch and a nice runscript which
  makes it possible to run fresco w/o omniORB.
