  16 Nov 2006; Ferris McCormick <fmccor@gentoo.org> afbinit-1.0.1-r5.ebuild:
  Marking stable and closing Bug #132464 --- No new problems have been reported
  for 3 months, and this change is needed for afb+current kernels.

  22 Oct 2006; David Shakaryan <omp@gentoo.org> -afbinit-1.0.1-r3.ebuild:
  Remove older version.

  11 Aug 2006; Ferris McCormick <fmccor@gentoo.org>
  -afbinit-1.0.1-r2.ebuild:
  Remove completely obsolete version.

*afbinit-1.0.1-r5 (09 Aug 2006)

  09 Aug 2006; Ferris McCormick <fmccor@gentoo.org>
  +files/rc.afb-1.0.1-r5.patch, afbinit-1.0.1-r4.ebuild,
  +afbinit-1.0.1-r5.ebuild:
  afbinit-1.0.1-r4 stable on sparc.
  afbinit-1.0.1-r5 modifies /usr/sbin/rc.afb so that it uses /dev/fbxx for the
  Elite framebuffer device(s) rather than /dev/fb/xx, because with current
  kernels, baselayout, udev, it seems that /dev/fb/xx devices no longer exist,
  and /dev/fbxx are the real devices rather than symbolic links into /dev/fb.
  
  This fixes Bug #132464 once again, thanks to Jan Holtzhausen (and to IRC user
  je_fro for raising the issue as well).

  06 May 2006; Ferris McCormick <fmccor@gentoo.org> afbinit-1.0.1-r4.ebuild:
  Add an RDEPEND for util-linux (it seems one could actually build a
  system without /bin/more on it.)

*afbinit-1.0.1-r4 (06 May 2006)

  06 May 2006; Ferris McCormick <fmccor@gentoo.org>
  +files/rc.afb-1.0.1-r4.patch, +afbinit-1.0.1-r4.ebuild:
  Version bump.  Proposed fix for Bug #132464 --- problems with afbinit and
  '/cat/ -s'.

  28 Apr 2006; Alec Warner <antarus@gentoo.org>
  files/digest-afbinit-1.0.1-r2, Manifest:
  Fixing SHA256 digest, pass four

  26 Feb 2006; Ferris McCormick <fmccor@gentoo.org> afbinit-1.0.1-r3.ebuild:
  Mark stable.  This needs to go stable because it is required by kernels
  >= 2.6.15, and they are required on SB1000 (earlier kernels have race
  instability problems of an unreproducible but unpredictable nature showing
  up as SegFaults and inability to build some packages, like sbcl).
  Change uses mmap shared rather than private, and should be safe on all
  systems.  Used only in init sequence.  Change courtesy Jurij Smakov.

*afbinit-1.0.1-r3 (31 Jan 2006)

  31 Jan 2006; Ferris McCormick <fmccor@gentoo.org>
  -files/rc.afb-1.0.1-r2.patch, +files/afbinit-mmap-1.0.1.patch,
  +files/rc.afb-1.0.1.patch, afbinit-1.0.1-r2.ebuild,
  +afbinit-1.0.1-r3.ebuild:
  Version bump to support kernels > 2.6.14, and to rename patch files to
  reflect that patches are revision-neutral.  Change is required because
  of kernel change in afb driver. (Thanks to Jurij Smakov and Debian Linux
  for sparc.)

  15 Jan 2006; Krzysiek Pawlik <nelchael@gentoo.org> -afbinit-1.0.1.ebuild,
  -afbinit-1.0.1-r1.ebuild:
  Removed old versions.

  22 Oct 2004; Ferris McCormick <fmccor@gentoo.org> afbinit-1.0.1-r2.ebuild:
  Mark stable for sparc.  This has been working fine for both kernel-2.4.xx and
  kernel-2.6.x systems.  If you have afb+kernel-2.6 it is required, and that is
  becoming less uncommon.

  28 Jun 2004; Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org> afbinit-1.0.1-r1.ebuild,
  afbinit-1.0.1-r2.ebuild, afbinit-1.0.1.ebuild:
  glibc -> libc

  27 May 2004; Ferris McCormick <fmccor@gentoo.org> afbinit-1.0.1-r1.ebuild,
  afbinit-1.0.1-r2.ebuild:
  Mark 1.0.1-r1 stable for sparc, and add ~keyword to 1.0.1-r2 for testing:
  1.0.1-r2 is required for afb (Elite) systems which are running 2.6.x kernels.

*afbinit-1.0.1-r2 (27 May 2004)

  27 May 2004; Ferris McCormick <fmccor@gentoo.org> afbinit-1.0.1-r2.ebuild,
  files/rc.afb-1.0.1-r2.patch:
  Version bump to add code to load the afb microcode for kernel 2.6.x series as
  well as for 2.4.x.

  14 Apr 2004; Daniel Ahlberg <aliz@gentoo.org> afbinit-1.0.1-r1.ebuild,
  afbinit-1.0.1.ebuild:
  Added IUSE=.

  24 Jan 2004; Brandon Hale <tseng@gentoo.org> metadata.xml:
  Fix corrupted metadata, bug 39234.

*afbinit-1.0.1-r1 (08 Jul 2003)

  08 Jul 2003; Jason Wever <weeve@gentoo.org> afbinit-1.0.1-r1.ebuild,
  files/afbinit.init:
  Changed afbinit install path to /usr/sbin and added rc.afb into /usr/sbin as
  well. Also added init script for afbinit thanks to Steve Moret
  <smoret-gentoo@genocide.net>.

*afbinit-1.0.1 (27 May 2003)

  27 May 2003; Jason Wever <weeve@gentoo.org> afbinit-1.0.1.ebuild:
  Initial commit.
