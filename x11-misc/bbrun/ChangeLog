*bbrun-1.4 (21 Feb 2003)

  21 Feb 2003; Matt Keadle <mkeadle@gentoo.org> bbrun-1.4.ebuild :

  Version bump to latest. I've removed the pgk_postinst() step from the ebuild
  that was adding an entry for bbrun to /etc/X11/Sessions/blackbox. If you don't
  have blackbox installed it would create an empty file. bbrun is usable in any
  *box window manager, and since this step isn't being made for either Fluxbox or
  Openbox it'll be up to the user to add bbrun to their .xinitrc is they want it
  auto stated on login
