  10 Jun 2002; Brandon Low <lostlogic@gentoo.org> xlockmore-5.04.ebuild :

  New version available fixes a problem some users were having with xlock
  looking for an image in a redhat subdir and crashing back to X (making
  it a BIT less effective as a locker).
  
  xglock appears to be integrated into xlock now, and xmlock does appear 
  to build successfully.

*xlockmore-5.03-r5 (24 Apr 2002)

  3 Jun 2002; Brandon Low <lostlogic@gentoo.org> xlockmore-5.03-r5.ebuild :
  
  Doesn't warrant a new revision just a fix for people with USE=-opengl
  ensures that it doesn't try to use any existing opengl libraries.  

  24 Apr 2002; Tod Neidt <tod@gentoo.org> xlockmore-5.03-r5.ebuild :

  Fix for Bug# 1810.  Install tarball supplied etc/xlock.pamd
  as /etc/pam.d/xlock if 'pam' is in USE.  Also unset setuid root if
  'pam' is in USE as one of the benefits of using pam is not running 
  apps such as this setuid root.  Also rolled back emake to make as the
  xlock build resets to -j1 anyway and this eleminates the error msgs.

*xlockmore-5.03-r4 (14 Apr 2002)

  14 Apr 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> xlockmore-5.03-r4.ebuild :

  If PAM is not in USE, cause it to use shadow instead for password locking.

  man page/LFH fix submitted by Matthew Kennedy.

  6 March 2002; Grant Goodyear <g2boojum@shivan.org> xlockmore-5.03-r2.ebuild :

  Fix esound dependency to be media-sound/esound.  Thanks to Jason Brown!

*xlockmore-5.03-r1 (2 March 2002)

  2 March 2002; Bruce A. Locke <blocke@shivan.org> xlockmore-5.03-r1.ebuild :

  Temporarily fix Makefile braindamage reported by user...  gtk and
  motif support fully disabled now.  Will stay disabled until someone
  submits a patch.

*xlockmore-5.03 (1 March 2002)

  1 March 2002; Bruce A. Locke <blocke@shivan.org> xlockmore-5.03.ebuild :

  An update to 5.03 and a major reworking on the ebuild to support
  more USE keywords...

  Known Issues: gtk and motif dialog boxes disabled due to configure
  script braindamage and I can't figure out how to tell xlock where its
  sounds are stored...  Low priority issues in a package I've spent too
  much time on already :(  If you figure it out, please file a bug report.
