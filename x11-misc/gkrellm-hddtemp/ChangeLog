*gkrellm-hddtemp-0.2 (10 Jun 2002)

  24 Jun 2002; George Shapovalov <george@gentoo.org> all :

  Reworked the ebuild to ask user to set suid bit on hddtemp instead of 
  setting it automatically. (it was decided that having an uncontrolled 
  by sysadmin suids is bad, besides hddtemp belongs to another package. 
  Please see the pkg_postinst function in ebuild for more).
