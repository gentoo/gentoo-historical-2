*gkrellweather-0.2.7-r2 (30 May 2002)

  30 May 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> gkrellweather-0.2.7-r2.ebuild :

  Hmmm.  The GrabWeather script is hardcoded into /usr/share/gkrellm only
  in the Debian version.  I added the debian patch which does just that.

*gkrellweather-0.2.7-r1 (18 Mar 2002)

  18 Mar 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> gkrellweather-0.2.7-r1.ebuild :

  Adjusted copyright, and made the script go into /usr/share/gkrellm where it is
  expected, instead of /usr/bin.  The expected location of the GrabWeather
  script seems to be hardcoded.

*gkrellweather-0.2.7 (1 Feb 2002)
