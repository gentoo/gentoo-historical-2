#What the hell was this trying to do? Make bbkeys automatically start?
#Well, I had to update this to at least attempt to work with the locations of
#X11R6 binaries. (They used to be in /usr/X11R6/bin, but alas, no more)
#Anyway you slice it though, this fails while blackbox is actually running, and
#I don't it'll work even if it not running. Also if I'm correct and this is what
#it's trying to do, I'd really suggest that you just use .xinitrc in your home
#directories. Add the command before the blackbox command and all is good.
