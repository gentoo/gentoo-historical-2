adesklets is an interactive Imlib2 console for the X Window system.
It provides scripted languages with a clean and simple way to write great looking,
mildly interactive desktop integrated graphic applets (aka desklets).
It can also be used as a command line oriented graphic editor,
a bit similar to ImageMagick , but with different functionality.
