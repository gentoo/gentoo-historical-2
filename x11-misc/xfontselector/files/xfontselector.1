       xfontselector  is a handy utility designed with purpose of
       easing the selection of fonts for  use  in  .Xdefaults  or
       other configuration files. The intent is to provide a much
       nicer interface than xfontsel.

       Start by resizing the main program window for your conven-
       ience.

       Next,  select  whether  font  should  be  scalable or not,
       select acceptable font sizes, widths, slants, heights  and
       names. To view your selection, click Show, a list of fonts
       matching the criteria should appear on the right  together
       with some test text (may not fit fully in the window).

       Select the fonts You like the most and click Print.

       The  final  list of fonts will appear in the terminal from
       which the program was started. The header will be Selected
       fonts.  Cut  and  paste those font names to .Xdefaults and
       other places according to your needs.
