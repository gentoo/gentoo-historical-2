  +files/modules.d-x11-drm, +x11-drm-20040827.ebuild,

  Moved xfree-drm ebuilds to x11-drm. No notable changes have been made to them.
  Snapshot 20040827 has been added, which begins the new versioning, since this
  is based on dri.sf.net drm snapshots. Improvements in the new snapshot include
  2.6 support for 2.6.6+ kernels and koutput, along with many upstream changes.
