# This is here to serve as a note to myself, and future developers.
#
# Any Display manager (gdm,kdm,xdm) have the following problem:  if
# it is started before any getty, and no vt is specified, it will
# usually run on vt2.  When the getty on vt2 then starts, and the
# DM is already started, the getty will take control of the keyboard,
# leaving us with a "dead" keyboard.
#
# Resolution: add the following line to /etc/inittab
#
#  x:3:respawn:/etc/X11/startDM.sh
#
# and have /etc/X11/startDM.sh start the DM in -nodaemon mode if
# a lock is present, else just fall through (with a big enouth
# delay so that init will not "detect" a respawning process and 
# halt if for some odd time).
#
# We then use /etc/init.d/xdm to control the presence of this
# lock, and this should ensure that the getty's is always started
# *before* the DM.
