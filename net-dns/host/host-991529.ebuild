# This is somewhat old tool, has not been changed since 1999,
# Still looks like host from bind does not provide all possible functionality
# at least xtraceroute wants LOC support, which is provided by this tool.

# This is the homepage for xtraceroute, not host, but that's the best I can do -
# at least it is mentioned there.
