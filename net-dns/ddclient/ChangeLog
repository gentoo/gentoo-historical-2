  -files/ddclient-3.6.3-mss1.diff, +files/ddclient.init,

  +ddclient-3.6.6.ebuild:
  Get rid of some crufy diffs in files/ -- the changes across the versioned
  diffs were not real changes, and so the diffs are shared now. Additionally,
  with this version bump is a new initscript to take advantage of the chuid
  argument to start-stop-daemon so that ddclient runs as the ddclient user,
  rather than root.
