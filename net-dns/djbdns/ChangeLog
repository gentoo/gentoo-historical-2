  Marked ~amd64.

*djbdns-1.05-12 (23 May 2004)

  23 May 2004; Jared Hudson <jhhudso@gentoo.org> : Added 4 new use flags: doc
  (adds dependency for djbdns-man), aliaschain (enables a patch to change the
  CNAME handling behavior of tinydns and axfrdns), semanticfix (enables a
  patch to increase the semantic handling of tinydns-data), and cnamefix
  (enables a patch to change the way dnscache handles CNAME records). For more
  information on the latter 3 patches please visit:
  http://homepages.tesco.net./~J.deBoynePollard/FGA/djbdns-problems.html
  In addition, if you include ipv6 support via the ipv6 use flag dnstrace
  will be compiled without ipv6 support now, since it was broken with it
  before. Also, a new setup script has been added, called djbdns-setup. This
  script can be used instead of dnscache-setup and tinydns-setup. This script
  was added by Kalin KOZHUHAROV <kalin@ThinRope.net> under bug #50795.
  Also, tinydns-setup is patched if the fwdzone useflag/patch is added
  because this patch changes the behavior of tinydns and the old tinydns-setup
  did not work properly with it. Other fixes and patch suggestions come from
  bug #19375, 20880, 34446, and 49578. Thanks goes to Nick Palmer
  <nicholas@slackers.net>, Thilo Bangert <fizzelpark-lists@gmx.net>,
  Hannes Just <Hannes.Just@fh-stralsund.de>, and Georgi Georgiev
  <chutz@gg3.net>
	
*djbdns-1.05-r11 (02 May 2004)

  02 May 2004; Jared Hudson <jhhudso@gentoo.org> :
  Added a patch and useflag to allow djbdns bind to multiple IPs per bug #48750
  thanks to der Ritter <gentoo@candlefire.org>

*djbdns-1.05-r10 (02 May 2004)

  02 May 2004; Jared Hudson <jhhudso@gentoo.org> :
  Added ipv6arpa use flag and patch to enable ipv6 arpa support per bug
  #49581 thanks to Georgi Georgiev <chutz@gg3.net>.

*djbdns-1.05-r9 (09 Apr 2004)

  09 Apr 2004; Joshua Kinard <kumba@gentoo.org> djbdns-1.05-r9.ebuild:
  Marked stable on mips.

  27 Mar 2004; Jared Hudson <jhhudso@gentoo.org> :
  fwdzone and roundrobin local use flags added to enable their respective
  patches. ipv6 will not work with roundrobin and fwdzone currently because the
  only patch we have for that combines all three. The problem with this is that
  fwdzone and roundrobin do not work together according to bug #31238. Due to this
  we are now using the original ipv6 patch when applicable.

  16 Nov 2003; Markus Nigbur <pyrania@gentoo.org> djbdns-1.05-r8.ebuild,
  files/headtail.patch:
  Coreutils Fix. Thanks to Marc in #33625.

  07 Nov 2003; Ciaran McCreesh <ciaranm@gentoo.org> djbdns-1.05-r8.ebuild:
  Moved to stable on sparc as -r3 has compile issues on sparc (thanks to
  aCrackOtter in #gentoo-sparc)

  16 Aug 2003; Tavis Ormandy <taviso@gentoo.org> djbdns-1.05-r8.ebuild:
  Stable on alpha

  24 May 2003; Jared Hudson <jhhudso@gentoo.org> : Added MAKEOPTS="-j1" to
  all djbdns ebuilds due to SMP compile problems when -j set higher than 1
  Bug ID: #18291

  17 Nov 2002; Jared Hudson <jhhudso@gentoo.org> files/ipv6-fix.diff,
  files/djbdns-1.05-fwd-ipv6.diff : Fixed Bug #8236 & 8236. Added static
  keyword to ebuild and changed ipv6 patch to work with the forwarding patch
  added in -r4.
	
  20 Oct 2002; Maik Schreiber <blizzy@gentoo.org> djbdns-1.05-r3.ebuild,
  djbdns-1.05-r4.ebuild: Cleaned up ebuilds. Also removed removal of
