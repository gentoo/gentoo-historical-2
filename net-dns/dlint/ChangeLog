  19 Oct 2004; Andrej Kacian <ticho@gentoo.org> :
  Fix deprecated use of head(1) and tail(1). Closes #67995, reported by Ray
  Booysen <bugzilla.gentoo@rjb.za.net>. Also, optimized the ebuild a bit.
  Added sys-apps/coreutils to DEPEND, since head and tail are provided by that
  package. And finally, set myself as maintainer for dlint.

  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
