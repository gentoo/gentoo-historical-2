For PowerPC laptops such as the iBooks and PowerBooks a special daemon named pbbuttonsd can handle the special "multi-media" keys to dim the display and regulate the audio volume accordingly.

However I find the example Gtk+ application gtkpbbuttons not that pretty.

So I implemented a more On-Screen-Display like variant. Currently it can utilize the XOSD library.

Although recently that other program got some pixmap theming support, it is still written in "handling every bit manually C" and still uses Gtk+.

The latest MacOSD deos now utilze the anti-aliasing and real alpha blending canvas library Evas. It does utilize gtkpbbuttons themes just fine - and comes with a slightly cleaned-up version CleanOSX

MacOSD is licensed under the terms of the GPL v2.
