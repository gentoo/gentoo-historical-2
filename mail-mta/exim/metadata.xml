Exim is a message transfer agent (MTA) developed at the University of Cambridge
for use on Unix systems connected to the Internet. It is freely available under
the terms of the GNU General Public Licence. In style it is similar to Smail 3,
but its facilities are more general. There is a great deal of flexibility in the
way mail can be routed, and there are extensive facilities for checking incoming
mail. Exim can be installed in place of sendmail, although the configuration of
exim is quite different to that of sendmail.
