# smtpplugins sample file
# none of these plugins is installed by default
# Paths are relative to the qmail home dir.
# #f you want your plugin to be executed by system shell, add ':' just before
# plugin path. this is slightly slower than normal mode.
#
# you may disable qmail-spp by setting NOSPP environmental variable - for
# example using tcprules
