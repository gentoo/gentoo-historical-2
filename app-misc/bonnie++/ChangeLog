*bonnie++-1.02c-r1 (14 Oct 2002)

  14 Oct 2002; Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org> :
  In gcc3.x, 'vector.h' is detected as not being installed (due to the
  fact that you're *supposed* to call it 'vector') ... and zcav is not
  built.  if you force the compilation ('make zcav') it will work, just
  complain that you're using an old header file (#9073)
  The version bump is because the install would continue even if zcav
  wasnt created/installed

*bonnie++-1.02c (26 Apr 2002)

  26 Apr 2002; William McArthur <sandymac@gentoo.org> bonnie++-1.02c.ebuild :
  Just renamed the ebuild for a newer version of the upstream package. Version
  1.02c fixes "a very serious bug in reporting of seek test results."

*bonnie++-1.02a (1 Feb 2002)
