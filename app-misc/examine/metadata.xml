Examine is a configuration library for applications based on the Enlightenment 
Foundation Libraries (EFL).
Using examine an application can register a property (key->value), modify or 
read a property, load and save these values to edb databases and listen to 
changes in the value.
The API for examine has been kept as simple as possible to allow programs to 
easily access configuration information, but also to expand the given 
structures to include application specific data.
Included with examine are two applications, examiner (still to come) and exsh.
These applications connect to the configuration library and allow the user to 
alter configurations.
The configurations are stored in edb format and can either be read from the 
default ~/.e/appname/config.db location, or from a specified file elsewhere.

More complex applications can make use of "bundles" (sets of properties) so 
that each window or view can use a different set of properties.
