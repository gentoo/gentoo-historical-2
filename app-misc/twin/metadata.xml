In these days where it is hard to find a graphic card without 3D acceleration, 
I brought back to life twin, a program that works in text mode.

Twin was born in 1993 as a DOS program, and it was the first big program I 
wrote immediately after learning C. I soon abandoned it, as under DOS there 
was no multitasking and I could not have any other program run inside the 
windows drawn by twin.

I resurrected twin in late 1999, when I was almost ending the military service 
and I had some spare time. In a single afternoon I ported it to Linux, then I 
started adding features: linux console emulation, networked server capability, 
X11 support, etc.

If you are still asking what is exactly twin, here is an answer:

Twin is a text-mode windowing environment: it draws and manages text windows 
on a text-mode display, like X11 does for graphical windows. It has a built-in 
window manager and terminal emulator, and can be used as server for remote 
clients in the same style as X11. It can display on Linux console, on X11 and 
inside itself.
