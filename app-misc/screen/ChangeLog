*screen-3.9.11-r4 (7 Nov 2002)

  7 Nov 2002; Michael Nazaroff <naz@gentoo.org> screen-3.9.11-r3.ebuild :

  I added in addpredict "${SSH_TTY}" and "`tty`" line into the ebuild to see if
  maybe this will actually fix the ebuild.  I've been getting support
  from Andreas Fink <koba@braindead.de> with the ebuild, since he can produce
  the issue and I cannot on my machine.

  11 Nov 2002; Michael Nazaroff <naz@gentoo.org> screen-3.9.11-r3.ebuild :

  Fixed a typo in the ebuild so the tty addpredict will should actually work.

*screen-3.9.11-r3 (27 Jul 2002)

  Added alpha to KEYWORDS

  23 Aug 2002; Michael Nazaroff <naz@gentoo.org> screen-3.9.11-r3.ebuild :

  Added a Addwrite line to the ebuild to try and fix a Sandbox
  violation. This is issue with vim as well and few other apps when logged
  in via ssh and trying to emerge the application.
  
  3 Aug 2002; Calum Selkirk <cselkirk@gentoo.org> screen-3.9.11-r3.ebuild :

  Added ppc to KEYWORDS.

  27 Jul 2002; Michael M Nazaroff <naz@gentoo.org> screen-3.9.11-r3.ebuild :

  Small typo fix.. /dev/ptys/* in ebuild instead of /dev/pty/*. Don't think
  needs revision bump.

  with portage-1.8.18
