*xosview-1.8.0 (12 Jul 2002)

  24 Jul 2002; Mark Guertin <gerk@gentoo.org> :
  Added set of ppc diffs (thanks mostly to mdk/ydl patches), but
  also had to make workaround for the fact that /proc/stat on PPC
  currently seems to have no EOF (?!?).  Will submit patches upstream.
  Also added ppc to keywords.

  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
