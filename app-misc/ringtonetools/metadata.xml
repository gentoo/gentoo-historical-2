  <longdescription>(Description from the main homepage, made from the author)
  Ringtone Tools is a program for creating ringtones and logos for mobile phones. This program has been tested by me on Nokia and Kyocera phones (including the Kyocera 6035 PDA Smartphone). I have support for Ericsson, Sony/Ericsson, EMS, Motorola, Siemens, Samsung, Handspring Treo phones, but I have no way to currently test it. I plan on adding support for other phones as soon as I get sponsors and testers.
