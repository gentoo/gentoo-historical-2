press x and a file will be saved in your home directory (assuming you have latex and dvips installed.
<br><br>
<b>Editor based entry</b><br>
when adding an entry enter "e" as the entry and an editor will be
started. the first line of the text you enter will be the text that
appears in ccal. You can access the further information you enter in
the rest of the file by pressing "e" over the entry in todo or entry
mode. You can also edit existing entries by pressing "e" over them. To
change the editor or the tmp path (defaults vim and /tmp) put something
like this in your config file:<br><br>
[editing]<br>
temppath=/tmp<br>
editor=vim<br>

<b>Colour coded entries</b><br>
Simply press 0,1,2 or 3 over an entry to change it's colour.  0 is normal.

There are three modes in ccal - Todo, Date and Entry.  You start up in Date mode.
<br><br><br>
<b>Date Mode</b><br><br>
In this mode you can press <i>left and right</i> to move back and forth through the days and <i>up and down</i> to move back forth through the months.  <br>
The calendar display in the corner highlights the currently viewed date and any dates which have entries<br>
<i>a</i> will add an entry and <i>/</i> will let you jump to a particular date<br>
pressing <i>enter</i> will move you into entry mode and pressing <i>t</i> will move you into todo mode<br>
finally <i>n</i> will take you back to today's entries and <i>q</i> will quit the program
<br><br>
<b>Entry Mode</b>
<br><br>
In entry mode you can move through the diary entries for a particulate date and delete them.  <i>up and down</i> move you through the entries and <i>d</i> will delete the currently selected one. <i>a</i> allows you to add a new entry <br>
<i>enter</i> will take you back to date mode<br><br>
<b>Todo Mode</b><br><br>
Todo mode functions exactly the same way as entry mode but you are adding to-do list entries not diary entries.
<br><br>
<h3>New - Internet database</h3>
Ccal -0.3 allows you to store your diary/journal and todo information
on a web server so that if you use ccal in several places, your
information will stay synchronised.
This is achieved by placing a cgi script (provided) on a web server
somewhere. The host of the cgi script must have python installed and
the script must be able to write to somewhere. The path that the script
should write to can be changed by changing the "<i> path</i>" variable in the cgi script.
You can then configure ccal to use this cgi script by creating a file in your home directory called .ccalrc <br>
This file should contain the following lines (with your server path in place of the one below):<br><br>
<b>[database]<br>
cgiURL=http://www.someserver.com/cgi-bin/diary.py</b>
<br><br>
If the config file is present and contains a cgiURL then ccal will use
internet storage by default, if it is not present it will use local
storage as in the original version.
You can also switch between the two types of storage in case of failure
or to create backups. Simple press <b>i</b> to switch between internet and local storage.  You will then need to press <b>l</b> to load, or <b>s</b> to save the database to the currently selected storage.  
<br><br>So if you want to copy your locally-stored information (from
ccal 0.2 for example) to your new internet-based storage you could
press <b>i</b> to switch to local storage, press <b>l</b> to load the database from the local store, then press <b>i</b> to switch back 
to internet storage and <b>s</b> to store the loaded database to the internet storage.    <br><br>
If you have internet-based storage setup then ccal will load from this
database on startup and save back to it on exit. This may take a few
seconds depending on your connection.
<br><br>You can view the day's appointments and the to-do list online
by simply entering the path of the CGI script in your web browser. I
was thinking about providing a more rich web-based interface and
possibly wap-access but I don't have much need for these myself. Let me
know if you'd like it.
