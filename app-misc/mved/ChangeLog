  14 May 2004; Jon Portnoy <avenj@gentoo.org> mved-0.3.5.ebuild :
  Initial import. This is a pretty handy utility -- it loads
  a list of filenames into your favorite editor, where you can
  edit the filenames and upon exiting they'll be renamed accordingly.
  Submitted and authored by Stefan Sperling (stsp@binarchy.net) in
  bug #43194.
