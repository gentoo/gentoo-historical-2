*rpc-0.97.ebuild (23 Feb 2003)

  23 Feb 2003; George Shapovalov <george@gentoo.org> rpc-0.97.ebuild, files/digest-rpc-0.97 :
  initial release (#13209)
  rpc is a fullscreen console-based RPN calculator that uses the curses library. Its operation is similar to that of 
  modern HP calculators, but data entry has been optimized for efficiency on a PC keyboard. Its features include 
  extensive scientific calculator functionality, command completion, and a visible interactive stack.
