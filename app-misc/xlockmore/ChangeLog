*xlockmore-5.03 (1 March 2002)

  1 March 2002; Bruce A. Locke <blocke@shivan.org> xlockmore-5.03.ebuild :

  An update to 5.03 and a major reworking on the ebuild to support
  more USE keywords...

  Known Issues: gtk and motif dialog boxes disabled due to configure
  script braindamage and I can't figure out how to tell xlock where its
  sounds are stored...  Low priority issues in a package I've spent too
  much time on already :(  If you figure it out, please file a bug report.
