*xlockmore-5.03-r2 (6 March 2002)

  6 March 2002; Grant Goodyear <g2boojum@shivan.org> xlockmore-5.03-r2.ebuild :

  Fix esound dependency to be media-sound/esound.  Thanks to Jason Brown!

*xlockmore-5.03-r1 (2 March 2002)

  2 March 2002; Bruce A. Locke <blocke@shivan.org> xlockmore-5.03-r1.ebuild :

  Temporarily fix Makefile braindamage reported by user...  gtk and
  motif support fully disabled now.  Will stay disabled until someone
  submits a patch.

*xlockmore-5.03 (1 March 2002)

  1 March 2002; Bruce A. Locke <blocke@shivan.org> xlockmore-5.03.ebuild :

  An update to 5.03 and a major reworking on the ebuild to support
  more USE keywords...

  Known Issues: gtk and motif dialog boxes disabled due to configure
  script braindamage and I can't figure out how to tell xlock where its
  sounds are stored...  Low priority issues in a package I've spent too
  much time on already :(  If you figure it out, please file a bug report.
