  16 Jan 2003; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> magicpoint-1.09a-r1.ebuild :

  Added charset16 support if both nls and truetype are in USE.  Closes bug

  23 Aug 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> magicpoint-1.09a-r1.ebuild :

  For some silly upstream reason, --enable-freetype disables it.  So, this
  is removed.  Thanks to: jherfurth@arafox.com (Julien Herfurth) in bug
  #6856.

  12 Apr 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> magicpoint-1.09a-r1.ebuild :

  Removed the ungif USE flag, and added nls and imlib and truetype USE dependent
  compilation.

  try to die and the copyright info.  Thanks to Matthew Kennedy for the update
  info.

  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
