*jpilot-0.99.2-r1 (27 May 2002)

  27 May 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> jpilot-0.99.2-r1.ebuild
  files/digest-jpilot-0.99.2-r1 :

  Recenly I updated the pilot-link and gnome-pilot and gnome-pilot-link
  packages.  As a result, the syncmal plugin for the jpilot package broke.
  Upon closer investigation, it turned out the syncmal-plugin itself has an
  updated version.  So, this revision differs only by the version number of
  the syncmal plugin.

*jpilot-0.99.2 (12 Feb 2002)

  12 Feb 2002; Bruce A. Locke <blocke@shivan.org> ChangeLog :

  Added 0.99.2 with updated malsync plugin and cleaned up ebuild

  PLEASE NOTE: reliable USB support with jpilot and other packages
  is dependent on having a CVS snapshot of pilot-link that is not
  source compatible with packages such as GNOME's Pilot support.

*jpilot-0.99-r2 (1 Feb 2002)

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
  
  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
