*jpilot-0.99.2 (12 Feb 2002)

  12 Feb 2002; Bruce A. Locke <blocke@shivan.org> ChangeLog :

  Added 0.99.2 with updated malsync plugin and cleaned up ebuild

  PLEASE NOTE: reliable USB support with jpilot and other packages
  is dependent on having a CVS snapshot of pilot-link that is not
  source compatible with packages such as GNOME's Pilot support.
