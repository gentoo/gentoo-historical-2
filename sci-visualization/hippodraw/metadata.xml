  HippoDraw provides a highly interactive data analysis environment. It
  is written in C++ with the Qt library. HippoDraw can be used as a
  stand-alone application or a Python extension module. In the latter
  case, Python is effectively the scripting language for HippoDraw. It
  was made for high energy astrophysics, but it is not specific. It
  contains good support for histograms and fitting.

<use>
  <flag name="fits">
    Enable HippoDraw's built-in support for reading FITS files,
    by using the CFITSIO library. FITS binary and ASCII tables are
    supported as well as images. When combine with numpy flag, it can
    also use the pyfits package.
  </flag>
  <flag name="numarray">
    Enable support for the obsolete numerical python array package
    numarray. Should not be used, since it's being deprecated.
    See bug #, and switch to numpy.
  </flag>
  <flag name="numpy">
    Enable support for the numerical array manipulation and
    computational capabilities of numpy in python.
    HippoDraw can return a numerical array to Python from any of the type
    of objects that are supported. One can also import data
    to a HippoDraw from a numpy array.
  </flag>
  <flag name="root">
    Adds support for ROOT input/ouput system, storing a table of data
    as TBranch objects each with a single TLeaf. Files of this type
    can be imported by HippoDraw as a RootNTuple. Also if root flag is
    selected, it can use root::minuit for minimization instead of
    standalone minuit library.
  </flag>
  <flag name="wcs">
    Adds 10 built-in transforms to HippoDraw via the World Coordinate
    System library for FITS files.
  </flag>
