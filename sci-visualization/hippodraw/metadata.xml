HippoDraw provides a highly interactive data analysis environment. It
is written in C++ with the Qt library. HippoDraw can be used as a
stand-alone application or a Python extension module. In the latter
case, Python is effectively the scripting language for HippoDraw. It
was made for high energy astrophysics, but it is not specific. It
contains good support for histograms and fitting.
