GalaxyMage is a free, open-source tactical/strategic RPG for Windows, Linux, and
Macintosh, with online multiplayer support.

A tactical RPG is a type of role-playing game where turn-based battles are
fought on a 3D map. Examples of commercial tactical RPGs include Final Fantasy
Tactics, Vandal Hearts, and Disgaea: Hour of Darkness.

Our goal is to make GalaxyMage a game that is relatively simple to pick up and
play -- you can dive right in without getting bogged down in the details of the
battle mechanics -- but to also allow for a lot of character development and
customization. We also intend to create a unique, advanced AI system that allows
enemy units to work together as a team and employ a wide variety of strategies.
