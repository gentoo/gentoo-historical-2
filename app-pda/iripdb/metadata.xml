iRipDB allows generating the DB files necessary for the iRiver iHP-1xx series of MP3/Ogg HD Player on Linux and Windows. That will allow you to navigate your files through the artist/album/genre menus. It supports adding MP3 and Ogg files at this point. It's released under the GNU's General Public License and, at this moment only in source code form.
