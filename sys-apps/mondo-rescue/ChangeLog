*mondo-rescue-1.61 (17 Jan 2003)

  17 Jan 2003; Brandon Low <lostlogic@gentoo.org> mondo-rescue-1.61:
  Bump to latest version, still instable.

  Changes: Various minor bugs were fixed. Mondo is now better at finding
  and mounting the correct CD-ROM drive when verifying CD-based 
  archives, in  the event that your PC has more than one CD-ROM drive.

*mondo-rescue-1.60 (14 Jan 2003)

  14 Jan 2003; Brandon Low <lostlogic@gentoo.org> mondo-rescue-1.60:

  This thanks to François-Xavier LAMARE <flx-linuxnews@ifrance.com>

  Updated dependencies (buffer is no longer needed)

  Updated src_install() procedure for the installation process to work
  the einstall() call didn't work (trying to install into /usr/local/)
  I rewrote the installation process conforming to the original Makefile 
  and Gentoo's specifications.
