  6 March 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> baselayout-1.7.3-r3.ebuild :

  Fix a bug where merging baselayout with 1.7.3-r1 already installed, would kill
  X when it was started with /etc/init.d/xdm.

  6 March 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> baselayout-1.7.3-r2.ebuild :

  Fixed the respawning "startDM.sh" process.  Fixed the fsck of / when rebooting
  for the first time after baselayout merge.

  5 March 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> baselayout-1.7.3-r1.ebuild :

  Update /etc/init.d/keymaps and /etc/init.d/consolefont to use the new
  sys-apps/kbd package.  More xdm fixes and safeguards in /sbin/rc.

  Added a "mkdir -p /etc/X11/" for if it do not exist.

*baselayout-1.7.3 (4 March 2002)

  4 March 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> baselayout-1.7.3.ebuild :

  Add updated xdm scripts to handle the "dead keys" bug. They should move to
  the xfree package when tested fully.

  Other minor ajustments.

*baselayout-1.7.2 (3 March 2002)

  3 March 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> baselayout-1.7.2.ebuild :

  Lots of updates and fixes, check /usr/share/doc/baselayout-1.7.2/ChangeLog
  for details.

*baselayout-1.7.1-r2 (25 Feb 2002)

  25 Feb 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> baselayout-1.7.1-r2.ebuild :

  Change devices to be created in ${D}/dev and not ${D}/lib/dev-state, as they
  are for use only when devfs is not used.

*baselayout-1.7.1-r1 (20 Feb 2002)

  20 Feb 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> baselayout-1.7.1-r1.ebuild:
  moved MAKEDEV device node creation to pkg_postinst() so that device nodes don't
  get recorded in CONTENTS.  Latest CVS Portage no longer records device nodes
  in CONTENTS since there's generally no point or clean way to unmerge them.

*baselayout-1.7.1 (6 Feb 2002)

  6 Feb 2002; M.Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> baselayout-1.7.1.ebuild :

  Move rc-scripts.tar.bz2 to CVS.  Remove forcefull install of /etc/devfsd.conf.

*baselayout-1.7.0-r1 (1 Feb 2002)

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
  
  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
