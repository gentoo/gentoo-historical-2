*baselayout-1.7.1-r1 (20 Feb 2002)

  20 Feb 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> baselayout-1.7.1-r1.ebuild:
  moved MAKEDEV device node creation to pkg_postinst() so that device nodes don't
  get recorded in CONTENTS.  Latest CVS Portage no longer records device nodes
  in CONTENTS since there's generally no point or clean way to unmerge them.

*baselayout-1.7.1 (6 Feb 2002)

  6 Feb 2002; M.Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> baselayout-1.7.1.ebuild :

  Move rc-scripts.tar.bz2 to CVS.  Remove forcefull install of /etc/devfsd.conf.

*baselayout-1.7.0-r1 (1 Feb 2002)

  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
