-# Dynamic /dev managers can trigger coldplug events which cause services to
-# start before we are ready for them. If this happens, we can defer these
-# services to start in the boot runlevel. If you don't want this then set
-# RC_COLDPLUG to no.
-# For more fine grained control you can list full service names to allow
-# them to coldplug and prefix them with ! so they don't coldplug.
-# Example - RC_COLDPLUG="net.wlan !net.*"
-# This allows net.wlan and any service not matching net.* to coldplug.
+# Do we allow services to be hotplugged? If not, set to RC_HOTPLUG="no"
+# NOTE: This does not affect anything hotplug/udev related, just the
+# starting/stopping of the init.d service triggered by hotplug.
 
 RC_COLDPLUG="yes"
 
+# Some people want a finer grain over hotplug/coldplug. RC_PLUG_SERVICES is a
+# list of services that are matched in order, either allowing or not. By
+# default we allow services through as RC_COLDPLUG has to be yes
+# anyway.
+# Example - RC_PLUG_SERVICES="net.wlan !net.*"
+# This allows net.wlan and any service not matching net.* to be plugged.

 # RC_NET_STRICT_CHECKING allows some flexibility with the 'net' service.
 # The following values are allowed:
 #  none  - The 'net' service is always considered up.
