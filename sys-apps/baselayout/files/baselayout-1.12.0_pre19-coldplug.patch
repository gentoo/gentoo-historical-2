 # Dynamic /dev managers can trigger coldplug events which cause services to
 # start before we are ready for them. If this happens, we can defer these
-# services to start in the boot runlevel. If you don't want this then set

-# For more fine grained control you can list full service names to allow
-# them to coldplug and prefix them with ! so they don't coldplug.

+# services to start in the boot runlevel. RC_COLDPLUG is a list of services we

 # This allows net.wlan and any service not matching net.* to coldplug.
