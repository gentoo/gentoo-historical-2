*coldplug-20040920 (20 Sep 2004)

  20 Sep 2004; Greg Kroah-Hartman <gregkh@gentoo.org> +metadata.xml,
  +files/coldplug.rc, +coldplug-20040920.ebuild:
  New package, coldplug.  Split out from hotplug to hold the 
  init script that tries to load modules for devices that are
  already present in the system at boot time.
  
  It can cause problems and lockups, so use at your own risk.
  
  I've disabled the ability to unload stuff at shutdown as that
  just caused too many problems, lockups, and oopses.  No other
  distro enables this feature, and now I realize why :)
