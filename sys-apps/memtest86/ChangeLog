  memtest86-3.0-r1.ebuild, files/digest-memtest-3.0-r1, ChangeLog :

  Installs the binary distributed with memetest86 rather than
  compiling it from source (which doesn't work with gcc3.2 at
  runtime). Upstream has been notified, but no response at the
  moment. Resolves bug #4088.

*memtest86-3.0 (03 Jun 2002)

  29 Sep 2002; Donny Davies <woodchip@gentoo.org> :
  Now uses mount-boot eclass, #7903.

  25 Sep 2002; Matthew Kennedy <mkennedy@gentoo.org> :
  Applied hanno's ebuild from http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4088 to fix my bad.

  24 Sep 2002; Matthew Kennedy <mkennedy@gentoo.org> :
  Replace patch with mandrake patch. Still doesn't seem to work
  properly though. Contacting upstream on this...

  22 Sep 2002; Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org> :
  It looks like a patch was developed to fix a bug but then never actually
  added to the ebuild ... so i put in the patch line in src_compile #8203

  21 Jul 2002; Mark Guertin <gerk@gentoo.org>:
  updated keywords (-ppc -sparc -sparc64)

  14 Jul 2002; phoen][x <phoenix@gentoo.org> memtest86-3.0.ebuild :
  Added KEYWORDS.

  03 Jun 2002; Karl Trygve Kalleberg <karltk@gentoo.org> memtest86-3.0.ebuild files/digest-memtest86-3.0 :
  Memtest86 is thorough, stand alone memory test for x86 architecture 
  computers. BIOS based memory tests are only a quick check and often miss 
  many of the failures that are detected by Memtest86. 

  Ebuild submitted by Alastair Nicol <ifni@blueyonder.co.uk>.
