*memtest86-3.0 (03 Jun 2002)

  24 Sep 2002; Matthew Kennedy <mkennedy@gentoo.org> :

  Replace patch with mandrake patch. Still doesn't seem to work
  properly though. Contacting upstream on this...

  22 Sep 2002; Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org> :
  It looks like a patch was developed to fix a bug but then never actually
  added to the ebuild ... so i put in the patch line in src_compile #8203

  21 Jul 2002; Mark Guertin <gerk@gentoo.org>:
  updated keywords (-ppc -sparc -sparc64)

  14 Jul 2002; phoen][x <phoenix@gentoo.org> memtest86-3.0.ebuild :
  Added KEYWORDS.

  03 Jun 2002; Karl Trygve Kalleberg <karltk@gentoo.org> memtest86-3.0.ebuild files/digest-memtest86-3.0 :

  Memtest86 is thorough, stand alone memory test for x86 architecture 
  computers. BIOS based memory tests are only a quick check and often miss 
  many of the failures that are detected by Memtest86. 

  Ebuild submitted by Alastair Nicol <ifni@blueyonder.co.uk>.
