Remove arbitrary requirement on the length of groups.  Perhaps we 
should turn this into a configure option and send upstream ?

 \fB\-g\fR \fIgid\fR
 The numerical value of the group's ID\&. This value must be unique, unless the \fB\-o\fR option is used\&. The value must be non\-negative\&. The default is to use the smallest ID value greater than 999 and greater than every other group\&. Values between 0 and 999 are typically reserved for system accounts\&.
 
+.SH RESTRICTIONS
+Currently, the shadow suite enforces the following restrictions on group 
+names:
+
+.nf
+\- must begin with a lower case letter or underscore
+\- can only contain lower case letters, underscores, and dashes
+\- regex for these requirements: [a\-z_][a\-z0\-9_\-]*
+.fi
+
+Normally shadow enforces a 16 character limit, but Gentoo adds patches to 
+remove it.
