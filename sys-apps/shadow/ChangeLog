*shadow-20001016-r9 (26 Feb 2002)

  26 Feb 2002; T.Neidt <tod@gentoo.org> shadow-20001016-r9.ebuild, login.defs

  Changed 'CREATE_HOME yes' to 'CREATE_HOME no' in login.defs.
  CREATE_HOME is a RedHat'ism and is not supported by the stock shadow
  package (see src/useradd.c).  When CREATE_HOME is set to 'yes',
  adduser generates a warning meassage. 

  Bumped ebuild revision so login.defs will be updated by emerge updates.
  
  Note to users:  'useradd -m <user>' will create the home directory and
  add any files in /etc/skel (see 'man adduser')
  

*shadow-20001016-r8 (25 Feb 2002)

  25 Feb 2002; M.Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> shadow-20001016-r8.ebuild

  Added a 'rm -rf ${D}/usr/share/man/*' to Chris's man fix to clean the
  Polish pages.  Added the line for installing /etc/pam.d/chage again, which
  should close bug #837.

*shadow-20001016-r7 (20 Feb 2002)

  20 Feb 2002; Chris Houser <chouser@gentoo.org> shadow-20001016-r7.ebuild
  files/digest-shadow-20001016-r7 ChangeLog :

  Changed man page installation.  More man pages are now included, and all
  should be in English (instead of the occasional Polish page).  This closes
  bug #594.

*shadow-20001016-r6 (1 Feb 2002)

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
  
  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
