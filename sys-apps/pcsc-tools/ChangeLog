*pcsc-tools-1.4.14 (11 Jan 2009)

  11 Jan 2009; Steve Arnold <nerdboy@gentoo.org> +files/smartcard.svg,
  +metadata.xml, +pcsc-tools-1.4.14.ebuild:
  New ebuild for pcsc-tools. Ebuild written by me. Very handy for setting 
  up and using PC/SC smartcards (tools that go with the daemon package).  
  Tested with a USB smartcard reader (Axalto Reflex USB v3).  The older 
  reader I tried (mentioned on several forum posts) won't work without 
  a firmware update.
