*pcmcia-cs-3.1.31-r5 (14 Mar 2002)

  14 Mar 2002; Karl Trygve Kalleberg <karltk@gentoo.org>: pcmcia-cs-3.1.31-r5:

  The test for the nocardbus USE flag was reversed. Fixed.

*pcmcia-cs-3.1.31-r4 (14 Mar 2002)

  14 Mar 2002; Chad Huneycutt <chadh@gentoo.org>: many fixes:
  1. added USE variables for trusted apps, apm, cardbus, and pnp
  2. updated init script to die slightly more gracefully when cardmgr
     cannot start
  3. changed configuration settings for init script (previously
     /etc/pcmcia.conf) to install instead to /etc/conf.d as the Gentoo-specific
     config
  4. Undid drobbins "-f" fix below, as it is not a very good default behavior,
     if , say, cardmgr starts dhcpcd, which can take a while to obtain
     information.  There is a CARDMGR_OPTS variable in /etc/conf.d/pcmcia where
     users can specify this if they want.
  5. I also put hermes.conf in ${FILESDIR}, but I am not installing it, as it
     causes cardmgr to choose the orinoco_cs driver over wvlan_cs, which may not
     be what the user wants.  It is documented pretty well that it must be
     downloaded, so I think it is safe to leave it out.

*pcmcia-cs-3.1.31-r3 (05 Mar 2002)

  05 Mar 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org>: properly install the pcmcia
  rc script into /etc/init.d; add -f option to cardmgr so that it stays in the
  foreground until it's done doing its thing.  This ensures that any network 
  interfaces are set up after it detaches.  This closes bug #972.

*pcmcia-cs-3.1.31-r2 (10 Feb 2002)

  10 Feb 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org>: Configure --srctree option
  added to tell pcmcia-cs to configure for kernel described in /usr/src/linux
  rather than the currently-running kernel (which is otherwise the default).
  We're now doing this the "right" way. 

*pcmcia-cs-3.1.31-r1 (1 Feb 2002)

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
  
  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
