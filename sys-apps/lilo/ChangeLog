*lilo-22.1-r3 (5 Apr 2002)

  5 Apr 2002; M.Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> lilo-22.1-r3.ebuild :

  Fix the /boot issue finally (hopefully :P)

  18 Feb 2002; Donny Davies <woodchip@gentoo.org> lilo-21.7.5-r1.ebuild :
  
  Cleaned up the comments I left behind in .ebuild.  Also added the pkg_setup() from
  lilo-22.1 into this one.. good stuff.  ATTN Maintainers:  This lilo has the
  patches from SuSe for animated boot logo stuff, quite fun, so please dont go
  deleting it because its simply older than the lilo-22.1 version in portage!
  I deleted the stale ebuilds to simply the situation.

*lilo-22.1-r2 (4 Feb 2002)

  4 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> lilo-22.1-r2.ebuild :
  
  Added new setup function which detects if /boot is mounted or not, in case
  it's not mounted it will try to do it automatically and in case of a failure
  exit with an error message.
  
*lilo-21.7.5-r1 (2 Feb 2002)

  2 Feb 2002; Donny Davies <woodchip@gentoo.org> lilo-22.1-r1.ebuild:

  Added several patches from SuSE for animated boot logos.  Not completly finished
  yet, but totally usable.  Please read the ebuild first before merging this!

*lilo-22.1-r1 (1 Feb 2002)

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
  
  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
