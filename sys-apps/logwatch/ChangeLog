*logwatch-4.3.2 (11 Apr 2003)
	
  11 Apr 2003; Jared Hudson <jhhudso@gentoo.org> : IMPORTANT NOTICE: I have
  changed the location of logwatch and its configuration files and scripts.
  logwatch.pl is now in /usr/sbin/logwatch.pl, the configuration files
  and scripts are in /etc/log.d This will match the way the author intended
  logwatch to be enabled while also allowing the configuration files to be
  monitored for changed and subject to etc-update when logwatch is upgraded.
  Credit goes to the following people: Alessandro Pisani <alextxm@tin.it>
  and Georgi Georgiev <chutz@chubaka.net> Bugs fixed: 13303 16016 16576 17746

  30 Mar 2003; Jared Hudson <jhhudso@gentoo.org> : Provider archived this
