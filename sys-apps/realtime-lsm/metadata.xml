Realtime Linux Security Module

This Linux Security Module (LSM) enables realtime capabilities.

Options:

# modprobe realtime any=1

Any program can request realtime privileges.  This allows any local
user to crash the system by hogging the CPU in a tight loop or
locking down too much memory.  But, it is simple to administer.  :-)

# modprobe realtime gid=29

All users belonging to group 29 and programs that are setgid to that
group have realtime privileges.  Use any group number you like.

# modprobe realtime mlock=0

Grants realtime scheduling privileges without the ability to lock
memory using mlock() or mlockall() system calls.  This option can be
used in conjunction with any of the other options.

The JACK Audio Connection Kit (jackit.sourceforge.net) includes a
jackstart program which uses CAP_SETPCAP to run the JACK daemon
and its clients with realtime capabilities.
