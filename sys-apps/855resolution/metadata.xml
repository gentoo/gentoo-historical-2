Utility to patch VBIOS (video BIOS) of Intel 855, 865, 915 chipsets.

This program is necessary to create and set video modes so that other
	programs (like X) can detect the modes.

855resolution is likely most useful to laptop owners with these
chipsets, who need to set miscellaneous video modes like
1400x1050 or 1280x800, and their VBIOS doesn't the mode in itself
after boot time.

Please consult the package's README.txt, or the homepage, for usage info.
