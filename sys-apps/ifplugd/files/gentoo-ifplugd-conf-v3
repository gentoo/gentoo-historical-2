# ifplugd configuration file

# Please note that this is a bourne shell fragment sourced by the
# init script of ifplugd.

# Specify the interfaces to control here, separated by spaces.
# Ifplugd processes will be started for each of these interfaces when
# the ifplugd init script is called with the "start" argument. You may
# use the magic string "auto" to make the init script start or stop
# ifplugd processes for ALL eth and wlan interfaces that are available
# according to /proc/net/dev. Note that the list of interfaces
# appearing in /proc/net/dev may depend on which kernel modules you
# have loaded.
INTERFACES="eth0"

# Additional parameters for ifplugd.
# See manual page ifplugd.8 for details.
# If you set AUTO to yes, you have to read http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=28362
# I recommend a delay of 0, both ways, since then, you can swap ethernet
# cables on different networks and get a new ip address.
# None of the programs I tested had a problem with the interface being
# gone in the mean time.
