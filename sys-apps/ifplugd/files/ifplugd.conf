# ifplugd configuration file

# Please note that this is a bourne shell fragment sourced by the
# init script of ifplugd.

# Specify the interfaces to control here, separated by spaces.
# Ifplugd processes will be started for each of these interfaces when
# the ifplugd init script is called with the "start" argument.
# If INTERFACES is not set then ifplugd processes ALL interfaces that are 
# available according to /proc/net/dev
# Note that the list of interfaces appearing in /proc/net/dev may depend on
# which kernel modules you have loaded.
INTERFACES=""

# If INTERFACES is not set above, then when WIRELESS_INTERFACES="no" then
# all interfaces found in /proc/net/wireless are excluded from ifplugd
WIRELESS_INTERFACES="no"

# Additional parameters for ifplugd.
# See manual page ifplugd.8 for details.
# I recommend a delay of 0, both ways, since then, you can swap ethernet
# cables on different networks and get a new ip address.
# None of the programs I tested had a problem with the interface being
# gone in the mean time.
