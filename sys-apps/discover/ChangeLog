  Discover is a hardware identification system based on the libdiscover1
  library.  Discover provides a flexible interface that programs can use to
  report a wide range of information about the hardware that is installed on a
  Linux system.  In addition to reporting information, discover includes
  support for doing hardware detection at boot time.  Detection occurs in two
  stages: The first stage, which runs from an initial ramdisk (initrd), loads
  just the drivers needed to mount the root file system, and the second stage
  loads the rest (ethernet cards, sound cards, etc.).
