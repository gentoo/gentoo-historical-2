DESCRIPTION="Discover hardware and load the appropriate drivers for that hardware."

LONGDESC="
 Discover is a hardware identification system based on the libdiscover1
 library.  Discover provides a flexible interface that programs can use to
 report a wide range of information about the hardware that is installed on a
 Linux system.  In addition to reporting information, discover includes
 support for doing hardware detection at boot time.  Detection occurs in two
 stages: The first stage, which runs from an initial ramdisk (initrd), loads
 just the drivers needed to mount the root file system, and the second stage
 loads the rest (ethernet cards, sound cards, etc.)."
