*wireless-tools-23 ( 10 Feb 2002 )

  10 Feb 2002; Karl Trygve Kalleberg <karltk@gentoo.org> ChangeLog wireless-tools-23.ebuild files/digest-wireless-tools-23:
  
  The Wireless Tools is a set of tools allowing to manipulate the Wireless 
  Extensions. They use a textual interface and are rather crude, but aim to
  support the full Wireless Extension.

    * iwconfig manipulate the basic wireless parameters
    * iwlist (formerly part of iwspy) allow to list addresses, frequencies,
      bit-rates...
    * iwspy allow to get per node link quality
    * iwpriv allow to manipulate the Wireless Extensions specific to a driver
      (private)
