*module-init-tools-0.9.1 (10 Dec 2002)

  10 Dec 2002; Brandon Low <lostlogic@gentoo.org> module-init-tools-0.9.1 :
  New unstable package for managing modules in 2.5 series kernels.  A
  bit complicated as it does overwrite the modutils system package,
  we'll need to take another look at this before 2.6 comes out.
