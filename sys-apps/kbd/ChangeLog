  29 Jul 2003; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> kbd-1.08-r1.ebuild:
  New configure script is even more broken than before - we should not add the
  prefix to the paths we pass --datadir and --mandir, else it looks for data in
  /usr/usr/share ... (bug #25448).
  Thanks to Nicolai Lissner <nlissne@linux01.gwdg.de> who did have the right
  solution (did not check bug again until now, so missed his feedback).
