#
#  This is a pared-down Bootdisk_Contents file for use with Yard.
#  You can certainly boot with fewer files than this, but you
#  probably wouldn't want to.  With these you can at least
#  do some basic disk maintenance.
#
#  Format rules:
#  - Lines beginning with # or % are comments.
#
#  - Blank lines and whitespace may be used freely.
#
#  - Filenames may be either relative or absolute.
#
#  - Lines of the form "filename1 -> filename2" will create
#    links on the boot disk.  Eg, if you want sh linked to bash
#    on the bootdisk, you can specify: "/bin/sh -> /bin/bash"
#
#  - Lines of the form "filename1 <= filename2"
#    will cause filename2 (relative to the current working directory)
#    to be copied to filename1 on the boot disk.  This is useful for
#    specifying trimmed-down replacements for /etc/passwd, /etc/inittab, etc.
#
#  - Wildcards (? and *) are generally allowed, eg /dev/*
#    Wildcards are not allowed in link specs or replacement specs.
#
#  You don't need to specify shared libraries or ld.so*.  The
#  script will detect dependencies (via ldd) and include them
#  automatically.
#
#  You don't need to explicitly specify intermediate directories
#  unless you just want them to exist.
#

#  Specify these absolutely because boot scripts need them to be here.
