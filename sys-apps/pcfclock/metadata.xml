		The pcfclock driver for GNU/Linux supports the parallel port radio
		clock sold by Conrad Electronic under order number 967602. The radio
		clock, which is put between your parallel port and your printer,
		receives the legal German time, i.e. CET or CEST, from the DCF77
		transmitter and uses it to set its internal quartz clock.
