PBButtons is a programm suite to support laptop specific functions and make them 
available again under Linux. Basically it was developed to support the special 
hotkeys of an Apple iBook, Powerbook or TiBook but since version 0.5 the design 
has been changed to support all kind of laptop or notebook.

With this programms the keys for the display brightness, the volume of speaker 
and headphone, the mute key and the eject key will do their job as expected. The 
daemon also do some power management tasks including low battery warnings, 
dimming the display if idle, sleep on command, etc.

The main part of PBButtons is the daemon pbbuttonsd which work as a server that 
do all the work. It runs in background and is preferable started at boot time. 
Multiple clients could register themselves to get messages about events from the 
server.

One of the clients is gtkpbbuttons. It displays small GTK popup windows each time 
a message from the daemon pbbuttonsd appeares.
