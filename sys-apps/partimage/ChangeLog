*partimage-0.6.2 (22 Dec 2002)

  22 Dec 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org>: added initial release. The
  original version of this ebuild was submitted in bug #11804 by Derek Young
  (d@young.hostforweb.com.) Thank you Derek for submitting this ebuild. Several
  fixes were made to this ebuild but the basic approach remains intact. One
  thing that make not be fully functional is the creation of SSL certificates,
  which according to Derek requires the "partimag" user (hacked out of the
  Makefile) to exist. Files originally intended to be owned by "partimag" are
  owned by root in this ebuild.
