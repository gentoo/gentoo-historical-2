*utempter-0.5.2 (03 Dec 2002)

  03 Dec 2002; Dan Armak <danarmak@gentoo.org> ChangeLog  :

  Utempter is a utility which allows some non-privileged programs to have
  required root access without compromising system security. Utempter
  accomplishes this feat by acting as a buffer between root and the programs.
