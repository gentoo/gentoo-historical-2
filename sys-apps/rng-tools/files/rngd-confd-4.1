# Bug #292239: Remixing /dev/urandom back into /dev/random is
# considered a security vulnerability in some cases where not enough
# entropy is present on systems. If you don't have a real random
# hardware generator, you're suggested to use a software designed for
# the particular task of creating new entropy, such as
# sys-apps/haveged.
