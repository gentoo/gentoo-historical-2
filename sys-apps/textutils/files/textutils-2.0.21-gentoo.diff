-Sometimes a few of the users try to hold total power over all the
-rest.  For example, in 1984, a few users at the MIT AI lab decided to
-seize power by changing the operator password on the Twenex system and
-keeping it secret from everyone else.  (I was able to thwart this coup
-and give power back to the users by patching the kernel, but I
-wouldn't know how to do that in Unix.)
-
-However, occasionally the rulers do tell someone.  Under the usual
-@code{su} mechanism, once someone learns the root password who
-sympathizes with the ordinary users, he or she can tell the rest.  The
-``wheel group'' feature would make this impossible, and thus cement the
-power of the rulers.
-
-I'm on the side of the masses, not that of the rulers.  If you are
-used to supporting the bosses and sysadmins in whatever they do, you
-might find this idea strange at first.
