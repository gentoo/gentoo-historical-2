  26 Apr 2003; Wout Mertens <wmertens@gentoo.org> lufs-0.9.5.ebuild :
  Fix sandbox failure for kernel 2.5. No revision bump because it just didn't
  build for 2.5. Fixes #18740, thanks to Jedi/Sector One.

*lufs-0.9.5 (05 Apr 2003)
  05 Apr 2003; Wout Mertens <wmertens@gentoo.org> lufs-0.9.5.ebuild :
  New upstream version, and it builds and works fine on all my test systems,
  and nothing depends on it. Only, if you do ldd /usr/bin/lufsd, you
  get many dependencies, and I want to have them in DEPEND before I
  declare these ebuilds stable.

*lufs-0.9.4 (18 Mar 2003)
  18 Mar 2003; Wout Mertens <wmertens@gentoo.org> lufs-0.9.4.ebuild :
  Turns out there was a new upstream version, and the init script and
  lufs user don't make sense any more because the daemon was rewritten.

  18 Mar 2003; Wout Mertens <wmertens@gentoo.org> lufs-0.9.3.ebuild :
  Fixed typo in install, -init was missing from the init script. Didn't
  bump revision since the people that have it running probably
  figured that out by themselves.

*lufs-0.9.3 (12 Feb 2003)

  12 Feb 2003; Luca Barbato <lu_zero@gentoo.org> lufs-0.9.3.ebuild
  files/digest-lufs-0.9.3 lufs-0.9.3-init
  ebuild submitted by Fred Point <fpoint@club-internet.fr>

  24 Nov 2002; Matt Keadle <mkeadle@gentoo.org> lufs-0.8.0-r1.ebuild
  files/digest-lufs-0.8.0-r1

  Fixed a symlink creation that has it's parameters reversed.

*lufs-0.8.0 (20 Nov 2002)

  20 Nov 2002; Daniel Ahlberg <aliz@gentoo.org> :
  Initial import.

*lufs-0.7.0 (01 Nov 2002)

  20 Nov 2002; Daniel Ahlberg <aliz@gentoo.org> lufs-0.7.0.ebuild :
  Fixed a typo, updated HOMEPAGE. Jan Andersson <janneand@yahoo.com> in #10992 found the typo.
  Repoman:ed and lintool:ed.

  01 Nov 2002; Daniel Ahlberg <aliz@gentoo.org> :
  Initial import. Ebuild submitted by Marko Mikulicic <marko@seul.org> in #7314.
