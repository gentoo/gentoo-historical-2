*iptables-1.2.5-r1 (20 Mar 2002)

  20 Mar 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> : iptables *requires*
  kernel sources to compile.  Before, we got away without them since we had a
  /usr/include/linux/autoconf.h.  Now we don't, and this means that we need a
  source tree handy.  Sad but true, and apparently the right thing to do.

*iptables-1.2.5 (1 Feb 2002)

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
  
  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
