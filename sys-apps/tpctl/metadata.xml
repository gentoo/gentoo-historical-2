tpctl is a package of configuration tools for Linux. 

The centrepiece of the package is tpctl, a program that does some of
what PS2.EXE does under DOS and the ThinkPad Configuration program does
under Windows.  (See the README file for a comparison of tpctl's
features with those of PS2.EXE.  You can consult this in combination
with this compendium of all the PS2.EXE help outputs on my ThinkPad
600.) 

tpctl gives the user access to all the functions of the SMAPI BIOS that
are documented in the various ThinkPad Technical Reference manuals.  It
can also control the resources used by the parallel and serial ports. 
The USAGE output and the README file should give a rough idea of what
the program can do.

tpctl accesses SMAPI and hardware resources through the drivers provided
in the thinkpad package.
