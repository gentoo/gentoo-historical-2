-Sometimes a few of the users try to hold total power over all the

-seize power by changing the operator password on the Twenex system and
-keeping it secret from everyone else.  (I was able to thwart this coup

-wouldn't know how to do that in Unix.)

-However, occasionally the rulers do tell someone.  Under the usual

-``wheel group'' feature would make this impossible, and thus cement the
