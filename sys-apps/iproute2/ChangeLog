*iproute2-2.4.7-r2 (29 Jul 2002)  

  29 Jul 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> made iproute2 kernel-source
  dependent again, removing woodchip's patch.  This is just how 'tc' and
  friends are designed, I guess.  The htb3 patches in particular want to see
  htb3 headers in the kernel source tree.

  14 Jul 2002; phoen][x <phoenix@gentoo.org> iproute2-2.4.7-r1.ebuild : Added
  KEYWORDS, SLOT.

  26 May 2002: Preston A. Elder <prez@gentoo.org>: iproute2-2.4.17-r1.ebuild:
  Removed -Werror from the makefile, which allows gcc 3.1 to compile.

*iproute2-2.4.7-r1 (7 Feb 2002)

  07 Feb 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org>: Added a
  dead-route-fix.diff to close bug #595 (see it for a description of the
  problem it fixes)
