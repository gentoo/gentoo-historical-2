*quota-3.06 (9 Dec 2002)

  05 Jan 2003; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> quota-3.06-r1.ebuild :

  NLS bloat reduction.  The upstream configure script needs to take care of
  that, though :/

  9 Dec 2002; Joachim Blaabjerg <styx@gentoo.org> quota-3.06-r1.ebuild :

  Added rc script from gregg@unix.net to -r1, and masked it for testing.

  06 Dec 2002; Rodney Rees <manson@gentoo.org> : changed sparc ~sparc keywords
 
  3 Dec 2002; Joachim Blaabjerg <styx@gentoo.org> quota-3.03.ebuild
  quota-3.04.ebuild :

  Removed old ebuilds. I assumed it was safe, as none of them were keyworded
  any different than 3.06, so I assumed they were obsolete. Kick me in the
  nuts if I'm wrong.
