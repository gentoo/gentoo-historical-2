*pmud-0.10.1 <kain@kain.org> ChangeLog:

	Sat, 13 Apr 2002 23:04:14 -0500; kain <kain@kain.org> pmud/*:
	Import of PMUD to gentoo. This works (kindof) on my Mac.
	On my TiBook, X is screwed if you are using the radeonfb driver and
	not a fbdev setup if you use this. :(  Could someone try this with a
	normal XFree 4.2.0/TiBook G4 and tell me what they get?
