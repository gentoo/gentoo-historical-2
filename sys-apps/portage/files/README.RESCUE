If your version of Portage dies for some reason, try using the
portage-rescue package as follows for Gentoo Linux 1.0+ systems:

# tar xjpUvf portage-rescue-1.8.16.tbz2 -C /

You'll see a warning about garbage at the end of the tarball/bzip2.  That's
normal and not a problem.  That should get Portage up and running again.
