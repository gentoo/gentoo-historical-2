If your version of Portage dies for some reason, try using the
portage-rescue package as follows for Gentoo Linux 1.0+ systems:

SUBSTITUTE A FILE THAT EXISTS FOR THE EXAMPLE VERSION BELOW.
IF AN ARCHITECTURE IS SPECIFIED IN THE FILENAME BE SURE IT IS
THE CORRECT ONE FOR YOUR ARCH.

**************************************************************
NOTE: This may overwrite make.conf. Please copy your original
      somewhere safe if you wish to keep it for reference.
**************************************************************

If you are not in this directory, you need to change to:
# cd /usr/portage/sys-apps/portage/files/

# IT MIGHT BE NECESSARY TO DOWNLOAD a portage rescue tarball from one of the
# following if one does not exist in this directory for your arch.
# ===> http://dev.gentoo.org/~carpaski/portage_rescue/
# ===> http://gentoo.twobit.net/portage_rescue/

Run the following to extract the tarball (substitute your arch for 'x86')
# tar xjpUvf portage-rescue-2.0.50-r1-x86.tbz2 -C /

You'll see a warning about garbage at the end of the tarball/bzip2.  That's
normal and not a problem.  That should get Portage up and running again.

It may be necessary to disable sandbox temporarily while you work out
the issues on your system. To do this just run:
# export FEATURES="-sandbox"
and when you finish getting everything fixed either close the shell or type:
# unset FEATURES

After the rescue portage is extracted do the following:
# emerge sync
# emerge portage

Everything should be fine from this point on.

For >=portage-2.0.50, this is optional, but will speed up
interactions with portage from this point on.
# emerge metadata



Best Regards,
  Gentoo Linux
