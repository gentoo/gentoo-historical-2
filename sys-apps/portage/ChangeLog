*portage-1.8.9_pre9 (21 Feb 2002)

  21 Feb 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> : many fixes and
  improvements too numerous to list here.  See the gentoo-src Portage ChangeLog
  (rather than this ebuild ChangeLog) for more info.  The major ebuild-related
  changed was the transition from spython back to python.

*portage-1.8.9_pre8 (12 Feb 2002) 

  12 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> portage-1.8.9_pre8.ebuild,
  files/digest-portage-1.8.9_pre8, files/portage-1.8.9_pre8.tar.bz2 :
  
  bugfixes and code cleanup
  
*portage-1.8.9_pre7 (11 Feb 2002) 

  11 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> portage-1.8.9_pre7.ebuild,
  files/digest-portage-1.8.9_pre7, files/portage-1.8.9_pre7.tar.bz2 :
  
  - internal bugfixes
  - sandbox related security fixes
  - removed support for --all and world in 'emerge --unmerge', by default now
    all matching packages are removed since with the new slots functionality
    old package versions should not exists anymore
  - colored package name red too when a blocking package is found during
    pretend operation
  - changed emerge invocation arguments to be in a new universal interface
    format this has been decided to be :
	'emerge --action --option --option [packageset]'
	some features however don't respect this, but that's since they are not
	package installation related and are easier to use as straight commands
	eg: emerge rsync
  - added UNMERGE_DELAY var to make.globals and support it in emerge to obtain
    the number of seconds to wait
  - support for NOCOLOR="yes" as wel as NOCOLOR="true"
  - major speedups for emerge -search
  - added formatted package descriptions of the matches from emerge --search
    that nicely wrap at 80 chars
  - rewrote retrieval of package descriptions to support descriptions that are
    specified on multiple lines
  - added support for 'noslot' to --zap, --update and --rebuild
  
*portage-1.8.9_pre6 (10 Feb 2002) 

  10 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> portage-1.8.9_pre6.ebuild,
  files/digest-portage-1.8.9_pre6, files/portage-1.8.9_pre6.tar.bz2 :
  
  - added support for 'emerge --unmerge world' which removes all old package
    versions from the system
  - made 'emerge --unmerge' take binary compatibility slots into account, this
    prevents that packages with different versions but also different slots, are
    being unmerged
  - added support for "--verbose" in "emerge rebuild" and "emerge world" to
    provide details about packages that aren't in the local tree anymore and to
    notify the user about which packages don't support slots
  - added support for the "emerge rebuild" mode which rebuilds all the packages
    on your system for which a corresponding package could be found in to
	portage tree
  - bugfixes to binary package merging
  - code cleanups and speedups

*portage-1.8.9_pre5 (6 Feb 2002)

  6 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> portage-1.8.9_pre5.ebuild,
  files/digest-portage-1.8.9_pre5, files/portage-1.8.9_pre5.tar.bz2 :
  
  - unmerging didn't work right when packages had the same slot, but different
    versions, this is now fixed
  - ebuild qmerge wasn't updated for the new slots behaviour
  - proxy configuration moved from make.globals to make.conf

*portage-1.8.9_pre4 (6 Feb 2002)

  6 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> portage-1.8.9_pre4.ebuild,
  files/digest-portage-1.8.9_pre4, files/portage-1.8.9_pre4.tar.bz2 :

  fixed more bugs in the binary compatibility slots, more specifically :
  - when trying to unmerge all instances of a package than was installed both
    without the slot functionality and with it, before this ended in an error
	message and failed to unmerge one of them
  - virtual packages didn't play nice with binary compatibility
  
*portage-1.8.9_pre3 (5 Feb 2002)

  5 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> portage-1.8.9_pre3.ebuild,
  files/digest-portage-1.8.9_pre3, files/portage-1.8.9_pre3.tar.bz2 :
  
  Only let the backward compatibility code kick in during unmerge since it's
  not possible to do the correct detections for general usage.

*portage-1.8.9_pre2 (5 Feb 2002)

  5 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> portage-1.8.9_pre2.ebuild,
  files/digest-portage-1.8.9_pre2, files/portage-1.8.9_pre2.tar.bz2 :
  
  - Fixed installation problem where output.py wasn't copied to the python
    modules directory.
  - Fixed bug in the unmerging of packages that were installed with an older
    portage version.

*portage-1.8.9_pre1 (5 Feb 2002)

  5 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> portage-1.8.9_pre1.ebuild :
  
  Install emerge to /usr/bin instead of /usr/sbin.

  4 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> portage-1.8.9_pre1.ebuild,
  files/digest-portage-1.8.9_pre1, files/portage-1.8.9_pre1.tar.bz2 :
  
  - Reinstated support for the "ebuild help" command which seems to have
    disappeared somewhere along prior updates.
  - Added description and default entry for the imlib USE variable.
  - Added flag to prozilla to disable prozilla's waiting for a user's keypress
    when a failure occurs.
  - Added alternative short flags for most emerge invocation options.
  - Emerge now doesn't unmerge the last version of an installed version by
    default anymore, to really remove all instanced of packages the --all flag
    has to be used, the --safe flag is deprecated.
  - Made it possible to run emerge --help and --search as non root.
  - All emerge output can now be turned to black and white by setting the
    NOCOLOR variable in make.conf or make.globals to true.
  - Implemented the ! dependency for ebuild authors which prevents incompatible
    packages from being installed on the same system at the same time.
  - Added binary compatibility slots. By default packages now install to their
    version number without the release number. Ebuild authors of packages that
	are expected to remain binary compatible across version changes, should
	add the SLOT variable to their ebuilds. The SLOT variable should contain a
	number. When a new package version is compatible with an older one, the same
	number should be used for the SLOT variable, this makes portage
	automatically unmerge the older package for which the new one is a drop-in
	replacement.

*portage-1.8.8-r1 (1 Feb 2002)

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> portage-1.8.8-r1.ebuild,
  files/digest-portage-1.8.8-r1, files/portage-1.8.8-r1.tar.bz2 :
  
  - Made env-update disregard backup files.
  - Added --pretend support to emerge --unmerge instead of interactively asking
    to proceed.
  - Implemented to noauto maintainer flag for all relevant ebuild commands.
  - Added a pkg_setup() function for ebuild authors which is executed before
    anything else and can be typically used for package configuration actions or
    required system checks
  
*portage-1.8.8 (1 Feb 2002)

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> portage-1.8.8.ebuild,
  files/digest-portage-1.8.8, files/portage-1.8.8.tar.bz2 :
  
  - Added emerge --unmerge support with an optional --safe option.
  - Cleaned up the handling of package names without categories to make it a
    drop-in replacement anywhere in portage.
  
*portage-1.8.7 (1 Feb 2002)

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
  
  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
