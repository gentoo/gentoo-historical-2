*portage-1.8.9_pre1 (5 Feb 2002)

  5 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> portage-1.8.9_pre1.ebuild :
  Install emerge to /usr/bin instead of /usr/sbin.

  4 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> portage-1.8.9_pre1.ebuild,
  files/digest-portage-1.8.9_pre1, files/portage-1.8.9_pre1.tar.bz2 :
  
  - Reinstated support for the "ebuild help" command which seems to have
    disappeared somewhere along prior updates.
  - Added description and default entry for the imlib USE variable.
  - Added flag to prozilla to disable prozilla's waiting for a user's keypress
    when a failure occurs.
  - Added alternative short flags for most emerge invocation options.
  - Emerge now doesn't unmerge the last version of an installed version by
    default anymore, to really remove all instanced of packages the --all flag
    has to be used, the --safe flag is deprecated.
  - Made it possible to run emerge --help and --search as non root.
  - All emerge output can now be turned to black and white by setting the
    NOCOLOR variable in make.conf or make.globals to true.
  - Implemented the ! dependency for ebuild authors which prevents incompatible
    packages from being installed on the same system at the same time.
  - Added binary compatibility slots. By default packages now install to their
    version number without the release number. Ebuild authors of packages that
	are expected to remain binary compatible across version changes, should
	add the SLOT variable to their ebuilds. The SLOT variable should contain a
	number. When a new package version is compatible with an older one, the same
	number should be used for the SLOT variable, this makes portage
	automatically unmerge the older package for which the new one is a drop-in
	replacement.

*portage-1.8.8-r1 (1 Feb 2002)

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> portage-1.8.8-r1.ebuild,
  files/digest-portage-1.8.8-r1, files/portage-1.8.8-r1.tar.bz2 :
  
  - Made env-update disregard backup files.
  - Added --pretend support to emerge --unmerge instead of interactively asking
    to proceed.
  - Implemented to noauto maintainer flag for all relevant ebuild commands.
  - Added a pkg_setup() function for ebuild authors which is executed before
    anything else and can be typically used for package configuration actions or
    required system checks
  
*portage-1.8.8 (1 Feb 2002)

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> portage-1.8.8.ebuild,
  files/digest-portage-1.8.8, files/portage-1.8.8.tar.bz2 :
  
  - Added emerge --unmerge support with an optional --safe option.
  - Cleaned up the handling of package names without categories to make it a
    drop-in replacement anywhere in portage.
  
*portage-1.8.7 (1 Feb 2002)

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
  
  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
