  27 Aug 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org>
  files/sh-utils-2.0.15-gentoo.diff :

  upgraded the diff to Carlos Georges' version. Still in beta, so more
  updates to that patch expected.

  Version bump, as requested by: klebermass@limtec.de (Martin Klebermass) in
  bug #6035.  The uname function has undergone some changes, so while this
  is masked for testing, I am waiting for a patch from Carlos for uname.

*sh-utils-2.0.11-r5 (21 Jun 2002)

  09 Jul 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org>

  Remove /usr/bin/hostname to install if "build" in USE, as it do not get
  removed during "emerge system", and breaks some packages (gnome2 among
  things).

  06 Apr 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> : updated the mtime of
  src/uname.c in order to thwart a perl dependency (bad mtime was triggering
  man page regeneration, creating a perl dep and breaking new build image
  creation)

*sh-utils-2.0.11-r4 (20 Mar 2002)

  14 Jul 2002; phoen][x <phoenix@gentoo.org> sh-utils-2.0.11-r4.ebuild :

  20 Mar 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> sh-utils-2.0.11-r4.ebuild :

  Found an updated patch for processor name in uname output from digiwano in
  #fluxbox and LKML.  New patch in ${FILESDIR} combines this and the rant-patch.

  Added a patch to uname.c from the nuname package.  This allows display in the
  uname output of more kinds of processors (AuthenticAMD, Cyrix, and possibly
  Alpha, even though Gentoo does not exist for Alphas yet :).
