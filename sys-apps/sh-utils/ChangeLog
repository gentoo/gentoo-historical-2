*sh-utils-2.0.11-r5 (21 Jun 2002)

  21 Jun 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> :
  Remove /usr/bin/hostname to install if "build" in USE, as it do not get
  removed during "emerge system", and breaks some packages (gnome2 among
  things).

  06 Apr 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> : updated the mtime of
  src/uname.c in order to thwart a perl dependency (bad mtime was triggering
  man page regeneration, creating a perl dep and breaking new build image
  creation)

*sh-utils-2.0.11-r4 (20 Mar 2002)

  20 Mar 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> sh-utils-2.0.11-r4.ebuild :

  Found an updated patch for processor name in uname output from digiwano in
  #fluxbox and LKML.  New patch in ${FILESDIR} combines this and the rant-patch.
  Now this should compile cleanly with "-* build" as well as normally.

*sh-utils-2.0.11-r3 (18 Mar 2002)

  18 Mar 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> sh-utils-2.0.11-r3.ebuild :

  Patch in ${FILESDIR} removes RMS's rant about su and the wheel group and
  fascism.

*sh-utils-2.0.11-r2 (12 Mar 2002)

  12 Mar 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> sh-utils-2.0.11-r2.ebuild :

  Added a patch to uname.c from the nuname package.  This allows display in the
  uname output of more kinds of processors (AuthenticAMD, Cyrix, and possibly
  Alpha, even though Gentoo does not exist for Alphas yet :).

*sh-utils-2.0.11-r1 (1 Feb 2002)

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
  
  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
