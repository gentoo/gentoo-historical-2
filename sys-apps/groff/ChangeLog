  Security update.

*groff-1.18-r1 (29 Jul 2002)
*groff-1.17.2-r2 (29 Jul 2002)

  29 Jul 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> groff-1.18-r1, groff-1.17.2-r2 :
  Some build Cleanups.  Enable build of xditview if "X" in USE,
  and X is actually installed.  We cannot make it depend on X, as
  X depends on perl, which in turn depend on groff and will cause
  circular depends.  Enable the install of info pages, and also
  fix thier extension to .info, else they do not get gzipped.
  Also fixed 0.18 to install its docs/examples in the right place.
