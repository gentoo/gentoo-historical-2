  915resolution is a tool to modify the video BIOS of the 800 and 900 series
  Intel graphics chipsets. This includes the 845G, 855G, and 865G chipsets, as
  well as 915G, 915GM, and 945G chipsets. This modification is neccessary to
  allow the display of certain graphics resolutions for an Xorg or XFree86
  graphics server.

  915resolution's modifications of the BIOS are transient. There is no risk of
  permanent modification of the BIOS. This also means that 915resolution must be
  run every time the computer boots inorder for it's changes to take effect.
