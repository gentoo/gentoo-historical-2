flashrom is a utility for reading, writing, verifying and erasing flash ROM chips. It's often used to flash BIOS/coreboot/firmware images.

Highlights of flashrom include:

    * Supports parallel, LPC, FWH and SPI flash interfaces.
    * Supports more than 150 flash chip families and half a dozen variants of each family.
    * Flash chip package agnostic. DIP32, PLCC32, DIP8, SO8/SOIC8, TSOP32, TSOP40 and more have all been verified to work.
    * Supports more than 75 different chipsets, some with multiple flash controllers.
    * Features special mainboard enabling code for dozens of nonstandard mainboards.
    * No physical access needed, root access is sufficient.
    * No bootable floppy disk, bootable CD-ROM or other media needed.
    * No keyboard or monitor needed. Simply reflash remotely via SSH.
    * No instant reboot needed. Reflash your ROM in a running system, verify it, be happy. The new firmware will be present next time you boot.
    * Crossflashing and hotflashing is possible as long as the flash chips are electrically and logically compatible (same protocol). Great for recovery.
    * Scriptability. Reflash a whole pool of identical machines at the same time from the command line. It is recommended to check flashrom output and error codes.
    * Speed. flashrom is much faster than most vendor flash tools.
    * Supports Linux, FreeBSD, DragonFly BSD, Solaris, Mac OS X, and other Unix-like OSes.
