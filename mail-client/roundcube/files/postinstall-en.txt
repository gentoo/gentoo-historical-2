0. DATABASE SETUP


* MySQL 4.1.x/5.x
-----------------
For MySQL version 4.1 and up, it's recommended to create the database for
RoundCube with utf-8 charset. Here's an example of the init procedure:

# mysql
> CREATE DATABASE roundcubemail DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci;
> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON roundcubemail.* TO roundcube@localhost
    IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
> quit

# mysql roundcubemail < ${MY_INSTALLDIR}/SQL/mysql5.initial.sql

* SQLite
--------
Sqlite requires specifically php5 (sqlite in php4 currently doesn't
work with roundcube), and you need sqlite 2 (preferably 2.8) to setup
the sqlite db (sqlite 3.x also doesn't work at the moment). Here is
an example how you can setup the sqlite.db for roundcube:

# sqlite -init SQL/sqlite.initial.sql sqlite.db

Make sure your configuration points to the sqlite.db file and that the
webserver can write to the file and the directory containing the file.

* PostgreSQL
------------
To use RoundCube with PostgreSQL support you have to follow these
simple steps, which have to be done as the postgres system user (or
which ever is the database superuser):

$ createuser roundcube
$ createdb -O roundcube roundcubemail
$ psql roundcubemail

roundcubemail =# ALTER USER roundcube WITH PASSWORD 'the_new_password';
roundcubemail =# \c - roundcube
roundcubemail => \i ${MY_INSTALLDIR}/SQL/postgres.initial.sql

All this has been tested with PostgreSQL 8.x and 7.4.x. Older
versions don't have a -O option for the createdb, so if you are
using that version you'll have to change ownership of the DB later.


1. ROUNDCUBE CONFIGURATION

Modify the files in ${MY_INSTALLDIR}/config/* to suit your local environment

Details about the config parameters can be found in the config files.
See http://trac.roundcube.net/wiki/Howto_Install for even more guidance.


2. PHP CONFIGURATION

  - error_reporting E_ALL & ~E_NOTICE (or lower)
  - file_uploads On (for attachment upload features)
  - session.auto_start Off
  - magic_quotes_gpc Off
  - memory_limit  (increase as suitable to support large attachments)


3. WEBSERVER CONFIGURATION

Access through your webserver to at least the following directories should be denied:

    * /conf
    * /temp
    * /logs 

Roundcube uses .htaccess files to protect these directories if you are using Apache;
be sure to allow override of the Limit directives to get them taken into account.

If you are NOT using Apache, it is your responsibility to take care of the above as
needed by your webserver.
