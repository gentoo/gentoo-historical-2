	The Anti-Spam SMTP Proxy (ASSP) Server project is an open source
	platform-independent SMTP Proxy server which implements whitelists
	and Bayesian filtering to rid the planet of the blight of unsolicited
	email (UCE). UCE must be stopped at the SMTP server. Anti-spam tools
	must be adaptive to new spam and customized for each site's mail
	patterns. This free, easy-to-use tool works with any mail transport
	and achieves these goals requiring no operator intervention after the
	initial setup phase.
