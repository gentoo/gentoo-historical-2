  07 Aug 2002; George Shapovalov <george@gentoo.org> spice-3.5.5.ebuild, files/digest-spice-3.5.5:

  SPICE 3 is a general-purpose circuit simulation program for nonlinear dc, 
  nonlinear transient, and linear ac analyses.  Circuits may contain resistors, 
  capacitors, inductors, mutual inductors, independent voltage and current 
  sources, four types of dependent sources, transmission lines, and the four 
  most common semiconductor devices: diodes, BJT's, JFET's, and MOSFET's. This 
  version includes support for the Bsim3 model (V3.1).
