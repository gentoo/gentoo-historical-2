*scilab-2.7-r3 (22 Mar 2004)

  22 Mar 2004; Patrick Kursawe <phosphan@gentoo.org> scilab-2.7-r3.ebuild:
  Trying to fix bug #40225 by providing an X server during build.

  11 Oct 2003; George Shapovalov <geore@gentoo.org> scilab-2.7-r2.ebuild :
  added few more dependensies for gtk interface

  06 Oct 2003; George Shapovalov <geore@gentoo.org> scilab-2.7-r2.ebuild :
  looks like gnome-lib is also needed for gtk interface, added it to DEPEND under gtk?

  05 Oct 2003; George Shapovalov <geore@gentoo.org> scilab-2.7-r2.ebuild :
  looks like enabling gtk makes scilab stop building macros,
  forced macros build in ebuild. 
  Also added check for previous version installed, as it would have
  caused problems fr this revision upon upgrade.
  Note: this check should be removed in new versions if they are issued 
  after reasonable amount of time passes (so that we can expect people to migrate to -r2)

*scilab-2.7-r2 (04 Oct 2003)

  04 Oct 2003; George Shapovalov <geore@gentoo.org> scilab-2.7-r2.ebuild :
  fixes ##28245 and 30219, thanks to the guys from the -r1 update :) and 
  to Toby Smith <thlsmith@iprimus.com.au> for the gtk hint
  now ebuild comes without postinst/remove functions

*scilab-2.7-r1 (16 Sep 2003)

  16 Sep 2003; George Shapovalov <geore@gentoo.org> scilab-2.7-r1.ebuild :

  thanks to Federico Zenith <zenith@chemeng.ntnu.no> and Gregorio Guidi <g.guidi@sns.it>
