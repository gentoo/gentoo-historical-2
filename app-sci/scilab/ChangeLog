  05 Sep 2003; George Shapovalov <geore@gentoo.org> scilab-2.7-r2.ebuild :
  looks like enabling gtk makes scilab stop building macros,
  forced macros build in ebuild. 
  Also added check for previous version installed, as it would have
  caused problems fr this revision upon upgrade.
  Note: this check should be removed in new versions if they are issued 
  after reasonable amount of time passes (so that we can expect people to migrate to -r2)
