*oregano-0.23 (13 Jun 2002)

  22 Sep 2002; Bruce A. Locke <blocke@shivan.org> oregano-0.23.ebuild:

  13 Jun 2002; Brandon Low <lostlogic@gentoo.org> oregano-0.23.ebuild:

  I was working a lab report this morning, tried to emerge xcircuit, but
  got SegFaults so I decided to find something else.  Then I made an
  ebuild for it.
