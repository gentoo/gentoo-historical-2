  Otter is designed to prove theorems
  stated in first-order logic with equality. Otter's inference rules are based on
  resolution and paramodulation, and it includes facilities for term rewriting,
  term orderings, Knuth-Bendix completion, weighting, and strategies for directing
  and restricting searches for proofs. Otter can also be used as a symbolic
  calculator and has an embedded equational programming system. Otter is a
  fourth-generation Argonne National Laboratory deduction system whose ancestors
  (dating from the early 1960s) include the TP series, NIUTP, AURA, and ITP.
