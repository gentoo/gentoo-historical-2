*gromacs-3.1.4 (08 Nov 2002)

  08 Nov 2002; George Shapovalov <george@gentoo.org> gromacs-3.1.4.ebuild, files/digest-gromacs-3.1.4 :

  new version.
  !!!IMPORTANT!!!
  I changed --prefix to point to /usr for FHS compliance.
  Now the binaries and the libs are getting installed into
  /usr/i686-pc-linux-gnu/{bin,lib} correspondingly and the data into /usr/share/gromacs-${PV}
  This seems to fit well in the existing direcory structure and does not conflict with gcc.

*gromacs-3.1.3 (27 Apr 2002)
  
  27 Apr 2002; George Shapovalov <george@gentoo.org> all_files :

  initial release.
