*zetagrid-1.8.2 (11 Mar 2003)

  11 Mar 2003; Michael Imhof <tantive@gentoo.org> :

  has been corrected upstream.

*zetagrid-1.0-r8 (02 Mar 2003)

  02 Mar 2003; Michael Imhof <tantive@gentoo.org> :

*zetagrid-1.0-r7 (01 Mar 2003)

  01 Mar 2003; Martin Holzer <mholzer@gentoo.org> files/zeta.init :

  01 Mar 2003; Michael Imhof <tantive@gentoo.org> :
  Changed /usr/bin/grep back to /bin/grep in zeta.init as
  the /usr/bin/grep was a mistake in the grep ebuild.
