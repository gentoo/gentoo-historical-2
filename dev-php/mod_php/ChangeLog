  1 Sep 2002; Brandon Low <lostlogic@gentoo.org> mod_php-4.2.2-r1.ebuild :

  Test your ebuilds, you can't just comment in the middle like that, then
  the next thing becomes a separate funky command.

  There is a compilation problem with the --with-gettext 
  variable being passed to configure from within portage.

  Clarify the pkg_postinst() message.

  16 Apr 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> :
  
  I caused the gettext bug.  The configure options do not like --with-gettext
  set.  They only like --without-gettext set.  Who knew?

  Hmm, and I did not edit the ChangeLog for some reason to say that the mhash
  and mcrypt flags are encapsulated by the crypt flag now.

  New release
  Fixed flash ming issue. Bug #2707

  Set register_globals = On in php.ini. Lower security but more
    compatibility. See http://www.php.net/release_4_1_2.php
  Readded curl/snmp/bz2/ssl. Tnx Todd
  Symlinked php.ini to old place. Tnx Todd.
  Disabled Java in ebuild. I'm not glad about it but it's imho the only

  27 Apr 2002; Ryan Phillips <rphillips@gentoo.org> php-4.1.2-r7.ebuild :

  for some reason --with-gettext doesn't find the libraries it needs. 
  ./configure --with-gettext from the commandline works fine.  reopening
  bug report.

*php-4.1.2-r8 (27 Apr 2002)

  27 Apr 2002; Ryan Phillips <rphillips@gentoo.org> php-4.1.2-r7.ebuild :

  Tweaked ebuild to include --with-gettext support.  This fixes #2106, but

*php-4.1.2-r6 (12 Apr 2002) 

  12 Apr 2002; Spider <spider@gentoo.org>

  update -r to force rebuild with updated libpng
  
*php-4.1.2-r5 php-4.1.1-r5 (12 Apr 2002)

  12 Apr 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> php-4.1.2-r5.ebuild,
  php-4.1.1-r5.ebuild :

  Changed the "gettext" USE flag to "nls" since that is the same thing.

*php-4.1.2-r5 (10 Apr 2002)

  10 Apr 2002; Donny Davies <woodchip@gentoo.org> php-4.1.2-r5.ebuild,
  files/mod_php.conf :

  Added a mod_php.conf file, which installs into the apache addon-modules config
  directory.  This eliminates the need to "sed" the apache config file in order
  to "turn on" the php mime types.  Removed some stale ebuilds/digests.

  Ooops, round two for today: fix the php.ini location with a symlink.
  Keeps things tidy.

*php-4.1.2-r4 (9 Apr 2002)

  9 Apr 2002; Donny Davies <woodchip@gentoo.org> :

  Small updates to fit in with the reworked apache package.

*php-4.1.2-r3 (13 Mar 2002)

  13 Mar 2002; Grant Goodyear <g2boojum@gentoo.org> :

  Minor update to fix bug # 1042.

*php-4.1.2 (28 Feb 2002)

  28 Feb 2002; Bruce A. Locke <blocke@shivan.org> php-4.1.2.ebuild :

  Major security fixes in this version.  All php users are urged
  to upgrade to this version.

*php-4.1.1-r5 ( 25 Feb 2002 )

  25 Feb 2002; Karl Trygve Kalleberg <karltk@gentoo.org> php-4.1.1-r5.ebuild

  Fixed a bug that made compiling with libpng bug out on some 
  installations.

  Old revisions removed.

*php-4.1.1-r4 ( 22 Feb 2002 )

  22 Feb 2002; Grant Goodyear <g2boojum@gentoo.org> php-4.1.1-r4.ebuild

  Now imap support should work.  Building php w/ imap support requires
  the uw-imap library and headers (from uw-imap or pine).  Annoying
  problem that uw-imap or pine needs to be compiled w/ SSL; otherwise
  the php build will fail due to header problems.

*php-4.0.6-r5 ( 18 Feb 2002 )

  18 Feb 2002; Karl Trygve Kalleberg <karltk@gentoo.org> php-4.0.6-r4.ebuild

  As Java support fails to work with Blackdown, and the fix seems non-trivial,
  Java support is removed from PHP 4.0.6 altogether.

  Old revisions have been removed.

*php-4.0.6-r4 ( 12 Feb 2002 )

  12 Feb 2002; Karl Trygve Kalleberg <karltk@gentoo.org> php-4.0.6-r4.ebuild

  Java support is back. The ebuild also tries harder to follow the style 
  guide.

  Old revisions have been removed.

*php-4.1.1-r3 ( 18 Feb 2002 )

  18 Feb 2002; Karl Trygve Kalleberg <karltk@gentoo.org> php-4.1.1-r3.ebuild

  Java is still here, but now it actually works with Blackdown as well.

  Old revisions have been removed.

*php-4.1.1-r2 ( 12 Feb 2002 )

  12 Feb 2002; Karl Trygve Kalleberg <karltk@gentoo.org> php-4.1.1-r2.ebuild

  Java support is back. The ebuild also tries harder to follow the style 
  guide.

  Old revisions have been removed.

*php-4.1.1 (1 Feb 2002)

  6 Feb 2002; Grant Goodyear <g2boojum@gentoo.org>:
  
  Added a new -r1 revision of the php-4.1.1 ebuild that adds
  two new USE variables, mcrypt and mhash.

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
  
  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
