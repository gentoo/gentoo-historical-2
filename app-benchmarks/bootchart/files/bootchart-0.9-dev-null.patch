Do not interfere with udev startup.
Running udev looks like this:
1. mounting empty tmpfs on /dev
2. mknod /dev/null and some others
3. Running udevd --daemonize

A running bootchartd writes to /dev/null all the time and so
creates a file /dev/null between 1 and 2. mknod refuses to overwrite files
and so udevd's stdin/out/err are connected to a file that gets deleted once
udevd creates all devices. So we buffer a useless file in memory as long as the
system runs.

Solution: Let bootchartd use its private copy of /dev/null
