*jmeter-1.8.1 (16 Mar 2003)

  16 Mar 2003; Dylan Carlson <absinthe@gentoo.org> jmeter-1.8.1.ebuild,
  files/jmeter-1.8.1-gentoo.diff:
  Initial import.
  
  Apache JMeter may be used to test performance both on static and dynamic
  resources (files, Servlets, Perl scripts, Java Objects, Data Bases and
  Queries, FTP Servers and more).  It can be used to simulate a heavy load on
  a server, network or object to test its strength or to analyze overall
  performance under different load types.  You can use it to make a graphical
  analysis of performance or to test your server/script/object behavior under
  heavy concurrent load.
  
  NOTE: This application requires Sun's JDK, and will not work correctly if you
  currently have your user environment set to use IBM's JDK, or another.
