#	LablGL and Togl configuration file
#
# Please have a look at the config/Makefile in the Objective Caml distribution,
# or at the labltklink script to get the information needed here
#

##### Adjust these always

# Where to put the lablgl script
BINDIR = /usr/bin

# Where to find X headers
XINCLUDES = -I/usr/X11R6/include
# X libs (for broken RTLD_GLOBAL: e.g. FreeBSD 4.0)
XLIBS = -L/usr/X11R6/lib -lXext -lXmu -lX11

# Where to find Tcl/Tk headers
# This must the same version as for LablTk
#TKINCLUDES = -I/usr/local/include
# Tcl/Tk libs (for broken RTLD_GLOBAL: e.g. FreeBSD 4.0)
#TKLIBS = -L/usr/local/lib -ltk83 -ltcl83

# Where to find OpenGL/Mesa headers and libraries
GLINCLUDES =
GLLIBS = -lGL -lGLU
# The following libraries may be required (try to add them one at a time)
# GLLIBS = -lGL -lGLU -lXmu -lXext -lpthread

# How to index a library
RANLIB = ranlib
#RANLIB = :

##### Adjust these if non standard

# The Objective Caml library directory
LIBDIR = `ocamlc -where`

# Where is LablTk (standard)
LABLTKDIR = $(LIBDIR)/labltk

# Where to put LablGL (standard)
INSTALLDIR = $(LIBDIR)/lablGL

# Where is Togl (default)
TOGLDIR = Togl

# C Compiler options
COPTS = -c -O

###### No need to change these

# Where to find tcl.h, tk.h, OpenGL/Mesa headers, etc:
INCLUDES = $(TKINCLUDES) $(GLINCLUDES) $(XINCLUDES)

# Libraries to link with:
LIBS = $(TKLIBS) $(GLLIBS) $(XLIBS)

# Leave this empty
LIBDIRS =
