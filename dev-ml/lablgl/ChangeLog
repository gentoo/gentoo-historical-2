*lablgl-0.98.ebuild (03 Sep 2002)

  28 Jan 2003; Jon Nall <nall@gentoo.org> lablgl-0.98.ebuild :
  added ~ppc

  24 Oct 2002; George Shapovalov <george@gentoo.org> lablgl-0.98.ebuild :

  made labltk and ocaml check-up logic more smart. Now should work fine in every situation.
  Thanks to Jeffrey Palmer <jeffrey.palmer.acm.org> for the tip on checking labltk existance.

  24 Oct 2002; George Shapovalov <george@gentoo.org> lablgl-0.98.ebuild :

  lablgl requires ocaml compiled with tk support. Ocaml has tk as an optional dependency.
  Added some code to pkg_setup to detect if the tcltk USE var is set and abort if not with the message
  asking user to emerge ocaml with tk support.
  See bug #8126 for details. Thanks to Sami Nieminen <sami.nieminen@iki.fi> for report and 
  Jeffrey Palmer <jeffrey.palmer.acm.org>  for dependency tracing and diagnostics.

  The above hack is goinmg to only catch 95% of situations. The real fix involves modifications to portage
  to make it correctly process optional dependencies of dependencies. See bug #2272 for details.
