Gentoo Linux

Thank you for using Gentoo Linux, a special flavor of Linux that can be
automatically optimized and customized for just about any application or
need. Extreme configurability, performance and a top-notch user and developer
community are all hallmarks of the Gentoo experience.

Thanks to our package manager, Portage, Gentoo Linux can become an ideal secure 
server, development workstation, professional desktop, gaming system, embedded 
solution or something else -- whatever you need it to be. Because of its 
near-unlimited adaptability, we call Gentoo Linux a metadistribution.
