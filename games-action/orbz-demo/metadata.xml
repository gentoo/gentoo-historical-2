Orbz is an action/arcade game set in colorful 3D environments. The object 
of the game is to shoot your orb at targets located throughout 14 distinct 
courses in a race to score the most points. Game play contains both 
intense action and also strategy in planning the best scoring shots. 
Power-ups, like the "Money Shot" and "Curse of the Goober", are also 
available to either give you a scoring advantage or to slow down your 
opponents.

In Solo Mode, the player completes a series of progressively difficult 
challenges that focus on scoring the most points in different scenarios. 
Bronze, Silver, and Gold medals are awarded for scoring performance and 
high scores for each challenge are tracked world-wide against all other 
Orbz players. For every 5 gold medals achieved, the player will also 
unlock a fancy new Orb to use in Solo or Online mode. Finally, there is a 
tutorial mode that will teach the player basics controls and scoring 
strategies.

The Online Mode allows Orbz players to compete against each other over the 
Internet or Local Area Network. Up to 10 players, including computer 
opponents called Botz, can join a Lobby where the matches will be 
coordinated by selecting the course to play, number of rounds in the 
match, and a per-round time limit. A world-wide ranking system is also 
available for those who wish to compete for the ultimate title of Orbz 
Champion.
