Descent 3 is a first-person 3-D action flight-sim which takes place in both
indoor and outdoor arenas.  The game was ported to Linux by the now defunct Loki
Entertainment and is commercial software.  You can still pick up a copy from
Tuxgames (http://www.tuxgames.com), but supplies are limited, as the publisher
is no longer in business.  This is the free demo version of the full game.
