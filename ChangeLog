Changing linux kernel structure
I'm in the process of changing the directory structure under sys-kernel so that it
follows our guidelines.  There will be two directories: sys-kernel/linux and 
sys-kernel/linux-sources.  The linux package contains a kernel, modules and headers so
that users can compile other sources.  The linux-sources package contains only the 
kernel sources; no kernel or modules are included.  The linux package is primarily of
interest for those setting up a Gentoo Linux box, while the linux-sources package is
more appropriate for geeks who already have a running Gentoo Linux system and want to
compile a more recent kernel by hand.
