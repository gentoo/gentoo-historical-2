Move from /etc/pam.conf to /etc/pam.d
This change will make it easier to update PAM information by having
applications drop appropriate configuration files into /etc/pam.d
instead of editing the pam.conf in /sys-apps/baselayout.  This change
modifies/updates the following portages:
    /sys-apps/baselayout-1.3 to baselayout-1.3-r1
    /sys-libs/pwdb-0.61-r1 to pwdb-0.61-r2
    /net-misc/openssh-2.2.0_p1 to openssh-2.2.0_p1-r1

More portage fixes
Fixed pkgmerge problem; it can now merge to non-local filesystems
and calls the pre and postinst scripts correctly.  Also, the DBDIR
variable in /etc/make.defaults has been depreciated.  From now on, the
database directory is assumed to be ${ROOT}/var/db/pkg.  Also tweaked
port_insttree() in portage.py so that the dbdir directory skeleton
is created if it doesn't already exist, and made portage.py check to
make sure that ROOT is an existing directory; otherwise it exits with
an error condition.

Changing linux kernel structure
I'm in the process of changing the directory structure under sys-kernel
so that it follows our guidelines.  There will be two directories:
sys-kernel/linux and sys-kernel/linux-sources.  The linux package
contains a kernel, modules and headers so that users can compile
other sources.  The linux-sources package contains only the kernel
sources; no kernel or modules are included.  The linux package is
primarily of interest for those setting up a Gentoo Linux box, while
the linux-sources package is more appropriate for geeks who already
have a running Gentoo Linux system and want to compile a more recent
kernel by hand.
