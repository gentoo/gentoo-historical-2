The Paketto Keiretsu is a collection of tools that use new and unusual strategies for manipulating TCP/IP 
networks. They tap functionality within existing infrastructure and stretch protocols beyond what they 
were originally intended for. It includes Scanrand, an unusually fast network service and topology 
discovery system, Minewt, a user space NAT/MAT router, Linkcat, which presents a Ethernet link to stdio, 
Paratrace, which traces network paths without spawning new connections, and Phentropy, which uses 
OpenQVIS to render arbitrary amounts of entropy from data sources in three dimensional phase space.
