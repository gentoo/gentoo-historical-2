  07 Jun 2004; Michael Sterrett <mr_bones_@gentoo.org> snorticus-1.0.4.ebuild:
  src_postinst() -> pkg_postinst()

  22 Mar 2004; Michael Boman <mboman@gentoo.org> snorticus-1.0.4.ebuild:
  QA: DEPEND/RDEPEND (see bug 45343). Noticed that it used plain patch instead
  of epatch, which also got fixed. The installed shell scripts depends on
  csh/tcsh which was not listed as a dependency, and the search path for the
  interpreter was wrong as well. All these issues fixed.

*snorticus-1.0.4 (13 Feb 2003)

  13 Feb 2003; Daniel Ahlberg <aliz@gentoo.org> :
  Initial import. Ebuild submitted by Paul Belt <gaarde@yahoo.com> in #8714.
