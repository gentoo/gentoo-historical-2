    Munin the tool surveys all your computers and remembers what it saw. It
    presents all the information in in graphs through a web interface. Its
    emphasis is on plug and play capabilities. After completing a installation a
    high number of monitoring plugins will be playing with no more effort. Using
    Munin you can easily monitor the performance of your computers, networks,
    SANs, and quite possibly applications as well. It makes it easy to determine
    "what's different today" when a performance problem crops up. It makes it
    easy to see how you're doing capacity wise on all limited resources.
