*nessus-libraries-1.2.3 (26 Jul 2002)

  26 Jul 2002; Nick Hadaway <raker@gentoo.org>
  nessus-libraries-1.2.3.ebuild, files/digest-nessus-libraries-1.2.3 :

  Split out the "nessus" ebuild to the individual nessues componets
  to allow pieces to build and install properly.  "nessus" is still
  an installable ebuild, it just pulls in the individual components.
  nessus-libraries is the first of those components.
