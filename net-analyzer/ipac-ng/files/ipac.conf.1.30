# This is the main ipac-ng configuration file.  It contains the
# configuration directives that give the ipac-ng its instructions.

## mode of operations: operate only like old ipac or not
## please note: you *should* specify YES, unless you are kaiser13 :)
## note2: you are trying to use 'ugly flawed experimental dangerous mode' 
##                             if you are using 'no', don't set it to no.

## specify access agent
# supported are: 'files', 'postgre'. 'files' works only with classic mode
# did you specify 'yes' above? Then you should set this here to 'files'.

## accouting agent
# supported are: 'iptables', 'ipchains'
#   (ipchains is not supported in nonclassic mode). does anybody still uses them?

## storage
# supported are: 'gdbm', 'postgre', 'files' (files is not recommended)
# postgre is the best & fastest method now.

# set the hostname, used to store\fetch\another work with database
# get from hostname() if not specified here

# specify *only* in nonclassic mode, otherwise forget about this
#auth host = sibinet.com

# dont store lines contains only zeroes to speedup processing and to save space

# This parameters controls database location
# left blank 'db host', 'db port' for local database
# as now, both databasess (access and storage) configured by these parameters
