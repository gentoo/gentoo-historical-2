*net-snmp-5.0.1 (29 Jun 2002)

  29 Jun 2002; Bruce A. Locke <blocke@shivan.org> net-snmp-5.0.1.ebuild:

  ucd-snmp has been renamed to net-snmp and this release appears to be 
  source incompatible with ucd-snmp

  Known Issue:  The new optional perl module support is disabled (due to
  configure/make issues) until someone who is familiar with the functionality 
  can contribute a patch.
