This project is a powerful tool for penetration testing, exploit development, and vulnerability research. 
The Framework is written in the Perl scripting language and includes various components written in C, assembler, and Python. 
This project can be roughly compared to commercial offerings such as Immunity's CANVAS and Core Security Technology's Impact. 
The major difference between the Framework and these commercial products is the focus; while the commercial products need to 
always provide the latest exploits and an intuitive GUI, the Framework was designed to facilitate research and experimentation with new technologies.
