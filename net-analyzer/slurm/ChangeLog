  and files/*:
  Credit goes to Jyrki Muukkonen <jyrki@kruu.org>. Initial import. His
  description follows (trimmed somewhat)-
  Includes two patches. One for some typos and color usage bugs and another
  for alternative color set (red and white, instead of the rather ugly default
  colors). It can be used with USE="altcolors". Note that I made this patch
  just for fitting slurm to my personal desktop. Nevertheless, wanted to
  include it. Maybe in future slurm will support external themes...
