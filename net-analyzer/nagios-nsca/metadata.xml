		This program is designed to accept passive service check results from
		clients that use the send_nsca utility (which is included in this
		package) and pass them along to the Nagios process by using the external
		command interface. The program can either be run as a standalone daemon
		or as a service under inetd. If you have libmcrypt installed on your
		systems, you can choose from multiple crypto algorithms (DES, 3DES,
		CAST, xTEA, Twofish, LOKI97, RJINDAEL, SERPENT, GOST, SAFER/SAFER+,
		etc.) for encrypting the traffic between the client and the server.
		Encryption is important in this addon, as it prevents unauthorized users
		from sending bogus check results to Nagios. Read the included SECURITY
		document for more information. 

		This package provides the send_nsca utility running on the client.
