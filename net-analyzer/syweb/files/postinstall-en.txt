Test your syweb installation by pointing your browser to the URL
http://${VHOST_HOSTNAME}/${VHOST_APPDIR}/configtest.php

Customize syweb by editing the file ${MY_INSTALLDIR}/setup.inc.

If you don't want any user interaction, move index_noui.php to index.php.

NOTE that syweb expects a machine/*.rrd style directory structure under
/var/lib/symon/rrds.
