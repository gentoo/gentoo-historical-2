*gentoolkit-0.1.1 (2 Feb 2002)

  2 Feb 2002; Leo Lipelis <aeoo@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :

  Jochem Kossen has added a nice diff/sdiff mode to etc-update.  As many
  people do not prefer vim, etc-update will now default to using diff for
  displaying changes and sdiff for merging changes!  This means, if you use
  any editor other than vim, the script will now work for you out of the box.
  But, vim users need not panic!  Vim diff functionality is still there in the
  script.  Just read the top of the etc-update file and configure it
  appropriately.  To sum up: vim users keep getting what they've been getting,
  and everyone else gets cool diff/sdiff mode.

*gentoolkit-0.1.0 (1 Feb 2002)

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
  
  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
