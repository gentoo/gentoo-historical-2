  30 Jan 2003; Jon Nall <nall@gentoo.org> mirrorselect-0.1-r1.ebuild,
  files/mirrorselect :
  made the GENTOO_MIRROR variable replacement a bit more robust; 
  added support for parsing what's already in /etc/make.conf's 
  GENTOO_MIRROR variable and automatically checking those

*mirrorselect-0.1 (30 Jan 2003)
  30 jan 2003; Mark Guertin <gerk@gentoo.org> mirrorselect-0.1.ebuild :
  Initial release, quick and ditry little dialog based script to pick
  your distfile mirror.  For now mirrors are hardcoded into script, but
  this will move of to something more dynamic when possible
