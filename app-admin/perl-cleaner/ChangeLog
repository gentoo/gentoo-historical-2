*perl-cleaner-1.01 (05 Jun 2005)

  05 Jun 2005; Michael Cummings <mcummings@gentoo.org>
  -perl-cleaner-1.0.ebuild, +perl-cleaner-1.01.ebuild:
  Sad to have a version bump already, but the is a code addition to be able to
  re-emerge everything, even those modules installed under our current version
  of perl. Comes up if someone (ick) changes from a threaded perl to a
  non-threaded perl - version doesn't change so perl-cleaner doesn't rebuild
  anything (though it needs to)

*perl-cleaner-1.0 (05 Jun 2005)

  05 Jun 2005; Michael Cummings <mcummings@gentoo.org> +metadata.xml,
  +perl-cleaner-1.0.ebuild:
  Initial import, prepping so perl-cleaner can be called from revdep-rebuilder
