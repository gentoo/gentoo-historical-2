  03 Jul 2007; Christian Faulhammer <opfer@gentoo.org> zenirc-2.112.ebuild:
  removed postrm and postinst, as they are exactly like that in elisp.eclass
  (make use of DOCS variable); killed DEPEND line on virtual/emacs; added a
  lot of quotes; replace configure and manual make commands through function
  equivalents; adjusted DESCRIPTION; added trailing slash to HOMEPAGE URI
