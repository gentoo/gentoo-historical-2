  Geant simulates the passage of subatomic particles through matter, for
  instance, particle detectors. Geant 3 simulations are performed by
  linking Fortran code supplied by the user with the Geant libraries,
  then running the resulting executable. This package includes gxint,
  the script used to perform this linking step.
  Geant 4 is a complete rewrite in C++ with addition of other modern
  features and detectors.
