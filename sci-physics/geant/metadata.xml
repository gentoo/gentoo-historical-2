  Geant simulates the passage of subatomic particles through matter, for
  instance, particle detectors. For maximum flexibility, Geant
  simulations are performed by linking Fortran code supplied by the user
  with the Geant libraries, then running the resulting executable.
  
  This package includes gxint, the script used to perform this linking step.
