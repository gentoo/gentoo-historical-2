  From the home page:

   UUDeview is a program that helps you transmit and receive binary files over 
   the Internet, using electronic mail or newsgroups The UUDeview package includes 
   both an encoder and a decoder. The decoder automatically detects the type of 
   encoding used, offering MIME's Base64 and BinHex as well as the popular 
   uuencoding and the less frequently used xxencoding methods. Recently, support 
   for the popular yEnc encoding was also added. The encoder runs the other way 
   around and encodes a binary file for sending it by mail or news.
