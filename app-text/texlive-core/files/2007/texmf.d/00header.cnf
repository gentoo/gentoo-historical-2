% texmf.cnf -- runtime path configuration file for kpathsea.
% (If you change or delete `original' on the previous line, the
% distribution won't install its version over yours.)
% Public domain.
%
% What follows is a super-summary of what this .cnf file can
% contain. Please read the Kpathsea manual for more information.
%
% texmf.cnf is generated from texmf.in, by replacing @var@ with the
% value of the Make variable `var', via a sed file texmf.sed, generated
% (once) by kpathsea/Makefile (itself generated from kpathsea/Makefile.in
% by configure).
%
% Any identifier (sticking to A-Za-z_ for names is safest) can be assigned.
% The `=' (and surrounding spaces) is optional.
% No % or @ in texmf.in, for the sake of autogeneration.
% (However, %'s and @'s can be edited into texmf.cnf or put in envvar values.)
% $foo (or ${foo}) in a value expands to the envvar or cnf value of foo.
%
% Earlier entries (in the same or another file) override later ones, and
% an environment variable foo overrides any texmf.cnf definition of foo.
%
% All definitions are read before anything is expanded, so you can use
% variables before they are defined.
%
% If a variable assignment is qualified with `.PROGRAM', it is ignored
% unless the current executable (last filename component of argv[0]) is
% named PROGRAM.  This foo.PROGRAM construct is not recognized on the
% right-hand side. For environment variables, use FOO_PROGRAM.
%
% Which file formats use which paths for searches is described in the
% various programs' and the kpathsea documentation.
%
% // means to search subdirectories (recursively).
% A leading !! means to look only in the ls-R db, never on the disk.
% A leading/trailing/doubled ; in the paths will be expanded into the
%   compile-time default. Probably not what you want.
%
% You can use brace notation, for example: /usr/local/{mytex:othertex}
% expands to /usr/local/mytex:/usr/local/othertex.  Instead of the path
% separator you can use a comma: /usr/local/{mytex,othertex} also expands
% to /usr/local/mytex:/usr/local/othertex.  However, the use of the comma
% instead of the path separator is deprecated.
%
% The text above assumes thet path separator is a colon (:).  Non-UNIX
% systems use different path separators, like the semicolon (;).
