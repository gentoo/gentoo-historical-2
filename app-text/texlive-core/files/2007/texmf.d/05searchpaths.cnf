%  Part 1: Search paths and directories.

% You can set an environment variable to override TEXMF if you're testing
% a new TeX tree, without changing anything else.
%
% You may wish to use one of the $SELFAUTO... variables here so TeX will
% find where to look dynamically.  See the manual and the definition
% below of TEXMFCNF.

% The tree containing the runtime files closely related to the specific
% program version used:
TEXMFMAIN = /usr/share/texmf

% The main distribution tree:
TEXMFDIST = /usr/share/texmf-dist

% The Gentoo site tree
TEXMFSITE = /usr/share/texmf-site

% A place for local additions to a "standard" texmf tree.
% This tree is not used for local configuration maintained by
% texconfig, it uses TEXMFCONFIG below.
TEXMFLOCAL = /usr/local/share/texmf

% TEXMFSYSVAR, where texconfig-sys stores variable runtime data.
% With teTeX-3.0 or later, this must be set.
% For sharing this tree with $TEXMFMAIN:
%   TEXMFSYSVAR = $TEXMFMAIN
% For using a separate tree:
%   TEXMFSYSVAR = $SELFAUTOPARENT/texmf-var
TEXMFSYSVAR = /var/lib/texmf

% TEXMFSYSCONFIG, where texconfig-sys stores configuration data.
% With teTeX-3.0 or later, this must be set.
% For sharing this tree with $TEXMFMAIN:
%   TEXMFSYSCONFIG = $TEXMFMAIN
% For using a separate tree:
%   TEXMFSYSCONFIG = $SELFAUTOPARENT/texmf-config
TEXMFSYSCONFIG = /etc/texmf

% User texmf trees are allowed as follows.
% This used to be HOMETEXMF.
TEXMFHOME = $HOME/texmf

% TEXMFVAR, where texconfig stores variable runtime data.
% With teTeX-3.0 or later, this must be set.
% For sharing this tree with $TEXMFMAIN:
%   TEXMFVAR = $TEXMFMAIN
% For using a separate tree:
%   TEXMFVAR = $HOME/.texmf-var  # teTeX 3.0 default
TEXMFVAR = $HOME/.texmf-var

% TEXMFCONFIG, where texconfig stores configuration data.
% With teTeX-3.0 or later, this must be set.
% For sharing this tree with $TEXMFMAIN:
%   TEXMFCONFIG = $TEXMFMAIN
% For using a separate tree:
%   TEXMFCONFIG = $HOME/.texmf-config  # teTeX 3.0 default
% For using a separate tree:
%   TEXMFCONFIG = $SELFAUTOPARENT/texmf-config
TEXMFCONFIG = $HOME/.texmf-config

% Now, list all the texmf trees. If you have multiple trees you can
% use shell brace notation, like this:
%   TEXMF = {$TEXMFHOME,!!$TEXMFLOCAL,!!$TEXMFMAIN}
% The braces are necessary.
%
% For texconfig to work properly, TEXMFCONFIG and TEXMFVAR should be named
% explicitly and before all other trees.
TEXMF = {$TEXMFCONFIG,$TEXMFVAR,$TEXMFHOME,!!$TEXMFSYSCONFIG,!!$TEXMFSYSVAR,!!$TEXMFMAIN,!!$TEXMFLOCAL,!!$TEXMFSITE,!!$TEXMFDIST}

% The system trees.  These are the trees that are shared by all the users.
% If a tree appears in this list, the mktex* scripts will use
% VARTEXFONTS for generated files, if the original tree isn't writable;
% otherwise the current working directory is used.
SYSTEXMF = $TEXMFLOCAL;$TEXMFMAIN;$TEXMFDIST;$TEXMFSITE

% Where generated fonts may be written.  This tree is used when the sources
% were found in a system tree and either that tree wasn't writable, or the
% varfonts feature was enabled in MT_FEATURES in mktex.cnf.
VARTEXFONTS = /var/tmp/texfonts

% Where to look for ls-R files.  There need not be an ls-R in the
% directories in this path, but if there is one, Kpathsea will use it.
%
% By default, this is only the !! elements of TEXMF, so that mktexlsr
% does not create ls-R files in the non-!! elements -- because if an
% ls-R is present, it will be used, and the disk will not be searched.
% This is arguably a bug in kpathsea, but we will not think about it now.
% 
TEXMFDBS = $TEXMF;$VARTEXFONTS

% It may be convenient to define TEXMF like this:
%   TEXMF = {$TEXMFHOME,!!$TEXMFLOCAL,!!$TEXMFMAIN,$HOME}
% which allows users to set up entire texmf trees, and tells TeX to
% look in places like ~/tex and ~/bibtex.  If you do this, define TEXMFDBS
% like this:
%   TEXMFDBS = $TEXMFHOME;$TEXMFLOCAL;$TEXMFMAIN;$VARTEXFONTS
% or mktexlsr will generate an ls-R file for $HOME when called, which is
% rarely desirable.  If you do this you'll want to define SYSTEXMF like
% this:
%   SYSTEXMF = $TEXMFLOCAL;$TEXMFMAIN;$TEXMFDIST
% so that fonts from a user's tree won't escape into the global trees.
%
% On some systems, there will be a system tree which contains all the font
% files that may be created as well as the formats.  For example
%   TEXMFVAR = /var/lib/texmf
% is used on many Linux systems.  In this case, set VARTEXFONTS like this
% VARTEXFONTS = $TEXMFVAR/fonts
% and do not mention it in TEXMFDBS (but _do_ mention TEXMFVAR).
%
% Remove $VARTEXFONTS from TEXMFDBS if the VARTEXFONTS directory is below
% one of the TEXMF directories (avoids overlapping ls-R files).
