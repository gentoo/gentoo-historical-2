  11 Jul 2002; phoen][x <phoenix@gentoo.org> ChangeLog, lout-3.25.ebuild, 
  files/digest-lout-3.25-r1, files/lout-3.25-r1-makefile-gentoo.patch :

  Initial cvs commit. Ebuild contributed by Christian V. J. Brüssow <cvjb@epost.de>.
  Thanks for the contribution.

  Authors comments:
  Beware: the original lout sources don't have a configure script. So I
  will patch the original makefile. The result should compile and install
  at least on any i386 Gentoo Linux. I don't have any experience with (e.g.)
  Sparc, PowerPC, ..., so YMMV.

  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
