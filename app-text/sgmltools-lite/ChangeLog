*sgmltools-lite-3.0.3-r4 (3 Apr 2002)

  15 Jul 2002; Owen Stampflee <owen@gentoo.org> :

  Added KEYWORDS.

  3 Apr 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> sgmltools-lite-3.0.3-r4.ebuild :

  Some users report that the CVS directories in the source tree cause emerge
  failures, so these are being removed before make install.

*sgmltools-lite-3.0.3-r4 (31 Mar 2002)

  31 Mar 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> sgmltools-lite-3.0.3-r4.ebuild :

  This addresses bug # 1163.  However, there are no symlinks being created for
  the binary.  Instead, a mini shell script is created to call the
  sgmltools binary with the appropriate flag.  Symlinks, however, are created
  for the man pages for the 5 extra binaries.

*sgmltools-lite-3.0.3-r3 (31 Mar 2002)

  31 Mar 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> sgmltools-lite-3.0.3-r3.ebuild :

  Fixed bug # 1369.  Also, added sgml environment generation into the
  pkg_postinst() function, so we do not need to jump through sed hoops to
  achieve that.

*sgmltools-lite-3.0.3-r2 (27 Mar 2002)

  27 Mar 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> sgmltools-lite-3.03-r2.ebuild :

  Man page/LFH fixes submitted by Matthew Kennedy.

  18 Mar 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> sgmltools-lite-3.03-r1.ebuild :

  Fixed a sandbox violation.

*sgmltools-lite-3.0.3 (1 Feb 2002)

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
  
  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
