*sgmltools-lite-3.0.3-r4 (31 Mar 2002)

  31 Mar 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> sgmltools-lite-3.0.3-r4.ebuild :

  This addresses bug # 1163.  However, there are no symlinks being created for
  the binary.  Instead, a mini shell script is created to call the
  sgmltools binary with the appropriate flag.  Symlinks, however, are created
  for the man pages for the 5 extra binaries.

*sgmltools-lite-3.0.3-r3 (31 Mar 2002)

  31 Mar 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> sgmltools-lite-3.0.3-r3.ebuild :

  Fixed bug # 1369.  Also, added sgml environment generation into the
  pkg_postinst() function, so we do not need to jump through sed hoops to
  achieve that.

*sgmltools-lite-3.0.3-r2 (27 Mar 2002)

  27 Mar 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> sgmltools-lite-3.03-r2.ebuild :

  Fixed a sandbox violation.
