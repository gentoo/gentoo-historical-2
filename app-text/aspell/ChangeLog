*aspell-0.33.7.1-r1 (12 Mar 2002)

  12 Mar 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> aspell-0.33.7.1-r1 :

  OK, finally this thing merges!  It has some _strange_ issues with optimisation
  levels. Specifically, they need to be specified _before_ ./configure.  Go
  figure.  Anyway, now this is compatible with the newest pspell library, not
  the older ones.  Also, this uses a patch from the author's page as well, in 
  order to actually compile.

*aspell-0.32.6 (1 Feb 2002)

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
  
  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
