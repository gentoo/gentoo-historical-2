*xmlto-0.0.15 (22 Oct 2003)

  22 Oct 2003; Mike Gardiner <obz@gentoo.org> metadata.xml,
  xmlto-0.0.15.ebuild:
  First version of xmlto. This version does not currently support tetex output
  to pdf/ps/dvi as we need a working passivetex/xmltex implementation before we
  can do that. Tex/pdf support is planned for the first revision of this package
