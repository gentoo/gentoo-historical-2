  CSparse a small yet feature-rich sparse matrix package written
  specifically for the book "Direct Methods for Sparse Linear Systems".
  The purpose of the package is to demonstrate a wide range of sparse
  matrix algorithms in as concise a code as possible. Note that the LU
  and Cholesky factorization algorithms are not as fast as UMFPACK or
  CHOLMOD.
