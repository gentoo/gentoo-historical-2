The GotoBLAS codes are one of the fastest implementations
of the Basic Linear Algebra Subroutines(BLAS).
To achieve performance it starts by observing that for current
generation architectures, much of the overhead comes from Translation
Look-aside Buffer (TLB) table misses. While the importance of caches
is also taken into consideration, it is the minimization of such TLB
misses that drives the approach.
