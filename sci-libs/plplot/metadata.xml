  plots. It can be used from within compiled languages such as C, C++,
  FORTRAN and Java, as well as interactively from interpreted languages such
  as Octave, Python, Perl and Tcl. It is capable of producing standard x-y
  plots, semilog plots, log-log plots, contour plots, 3D surface plots, mesh
  plots, bar charts and pie charts. Multiple graphs may be composited, and it
  also supports a large variety of output file devices such as Postscript,
  PNG, JPEG, LaTeX and others. It is also possible to to use interactive
  devices such as xwin, tk and xterm as output devices. PLplot also offers
