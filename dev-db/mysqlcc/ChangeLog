*mysqlcc-0.8.10-r1 (04 Mar 2003)

  04 Mar 2003; Robert Coie <rac@gentoo.org> mysqlcc-0.8.10-r1.ebuild,
  files/mysqlcc-0.8.10-libmysqlclientac.patch,
  files/mysqlcc-0.8.10-qmakespec.patch:
  The config.sub included with this package does not recognize linux-gnu
  machines correctly, so replace it with one taken from a local automake
  installation and run autoreconf.  Allow the ebuild to override the
  QMAKESPEC variable, so that 'linux-g++' is picked up correctly.
  Replace the libmysqlclient autoconf macro with a simpler and sleeker
  use of mysql_config, so that optionally dependent libraries (such as
  libssl) are picked up for free.  Make dependency on MySQL >=4.0, as
  this version attempts to use command-line option processing from
  libmysqlclient that is not available before that version.  Fixes bug
  #16733.  Thanks to Peter Penkala <pjp@gentoo.org> for testing
  assistance.
