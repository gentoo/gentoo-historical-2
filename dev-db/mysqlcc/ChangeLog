  15 Aug 2003; <caleb@gentoo.org> mysqlcc-0.9.2.ebuild:
  Minor CFLAGS (see bug 26669).  Changed qt dependecy to rely on need-qt from
  kde-functions.eclass.  Marked stable on x86.

  12 Jun 2003; <msterret@gentoo.org> mysqlcc-0.8.7-r1.ebuild:
  fix Header

  04 Jun 2003; Caleb Tennis <caleb@gentoo.org>
  removed stale ebuilds: 0.8.6a, 0.8.7, 0.8.10, 0.8.10-r1

*mysqlcc-0.9.2 (05 May 2003)

  05 May 2003; <caleb@gentoo.org> mysqlcc-0.9.2.ebuild,
  files/mysqlcc-0.9.2-configperms.patch, files/mysqlcc-0.8.7-qmakespec.patch:
  Version bump, keeping same patches as version noted below.  Keeping ~86
  until mysql-4 becomes unmasked in portage.

*mysqlcc-0.8.7-r1 (09 Mar 2003)

  09 Mar 2003; <rac@gentoo.org> mysqlcc-0.8.7-r1.ebuild,
  files/mysqlcc-0.8.7-configperms.patch, files/mysqlcc-0.8.7-qmakespec.patch:
  The config.sub included with this package does not recognize linux-gnu
  machines correctly, so replace it with one taken from a local automake
  installation and run autoreconf.  Allow the ebuild to override the
  QMAKESPEC variable, so that 'linux-g++' is picked up correctly.  These
  are backported from the 0.8.10-r1 ebuild.  Also attempt to backport
  the security fix eliminating world-readable configuration files and
  directories that was applied upstream in 0.8.9, since 0.8.7 seems to
  be the last version that will compile against MySQL 3.x.

*mysqlcc-0.8.10-r1 (04 Mar 2003)

  09 Mar 2003; <rac@gentoo.org> mysqlcc-0.8.10-r1.ebuild:
  remasked to avoid depending on unstable mysql

  04 Mar 2003; Robert Coie <rac@gentoo.org> mysqlcc-0.8.10-r1.ebuild,
  files/mysqlcc-0.8.10-libmysqlclientac.patch,
  files/mysqlcc-0.8.10-qmakespec.patch:
  The config.sub included with this package does not recognize linux-gnu
  machines correctly, so replace it with one taken from a local automake
  installation and run autoreconf.  Allow the ebuild to override the
  QMAKESPEC variable, so that 'linux-g++' is picked up correctly.
  Replace the libmysqlclient autoconf macro with a simpler and sleeker
  use of mysql_config, so that optionally dependent libraries (such as
  libssl) are picked up for free.  Make dependency on MySQL >=4.0, as
  this version attempts to use command-line option processing from
  libmysqlclient that is not available before that version.  Fixes bug
  #16733.  Thanks to Peter Penkala <pjp@gentoo.org> for testing
  assistance.

*mysqlcc-0.8.10 (03 Mar 2003)

  03 Mar 2003; Daniel Ahlberg <aliz@gentoo.org> :
