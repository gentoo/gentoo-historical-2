*mysql++-1.7.9-r1 (08 May 2003)

  08 May 2003; Robin Johnson <robbat2@gentoo.org> : mysql++-1.7.9-r1.ebuild,
  files/mysql++-1.7.9-gcc_throw.patch,
  files/mysql++-1.7.9-mysql4-gcc295.patch,
  files/mysql++-1.7.9-mysql4-gcc3.patch, files/mysql++-gcc-3.2.patch:
  Import many fixes for MySQL++ so it works with MySQLv4, as well as removing
  warnings and other bumpf. Also made sure CFLAGS/CXXFLAGS get used in the
  compile (they were not previously).
  Moved the include directory to /usr/include/mysql++ due to breakage caused
  by the large number of files put into it (it overwrote some other headers); 
  This may break some other code, testing is needed!
  Bugs #15688, #20635 resolved.
