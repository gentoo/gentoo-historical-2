*sqlguipart-0.4 (21 Aug 2002)

  21 Aug 2002; Dan Armak <danarmak@gentoo.org> ChangeLog  :

  Initial ebuild. This is the 'core' of dev-db/sqlgui, which has been in this
  version separated in to a kpart that comes in a stnadalone package. You'll
  need sqlgui itself to do anythng with it (except writing a new frontend).
