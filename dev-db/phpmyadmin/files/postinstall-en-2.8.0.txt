0. Update MySQL's grant tables and the pmadb database:
     mysql -u root -p < /usr/share/webapps/phpmyadmin/${PVR}/sqlscripts/mysql/${PVR}_create.sql

1. Create the file config.inc.php. You can use the web-based installer:
   http://${VHOST_HOSTNAME}${VHOST_APPDIR}/scripts/setup.php
   Alternatively, use the default config file in libraries/config.default.php

2. Be sure that the libraries/ directory is not visible. You can use the
provided .htaccess file.

===============

If you are upgrading from an earlier version and are using phpMyAdmin's
features for master/foreign tables be sure to read
  http://${VHOST_HOSTNAME}${VHOST_APPDIR}/Documentation.html#col_com
You will need to perform the ALTER TABLE step yourself.
