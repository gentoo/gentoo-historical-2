0. If this is a new installation, create MySQL's grant tables and the pmadb
   database. NOTE: this will change the existing pma password to a random
   string!

     mysql -u root -p < /usr/share/webapps/phpmyadmin/${PVR}/sqlscripts/mysql/${PVR}_create.sql

1. Create config.inc.php. You can use the web-based installer:
   http://${VHOST_HOSTNAME}/${VHOST_APPDIR}/scripts/setup.php

   Alternatively, use the default config file in libraries/config.default.php

   mkdir ${MY_INSTALLDIR}/config
   chmod o+rw ${MY_INSTALLDIR}/config
   # if you want to edit existing configuration:
   cp ${MY_INSTALLDIR}/config.inc.php ${MY_INSTALLDIR}/config/
   chown -R VHOST_SERVER_GID:VHOST_SERVER_UID ${MY_INSTALLDIR}/config

2. Be sure that the libraries/ directory is not visible. You can use the
provided .htaccess file.

===============

If you are upgrading from an earlier version and are using phpMyAdmin's
features for master/foreign tables be sure to read
  http://${VHOST_HOSTNAME}/${VHOST_APPDIR}/Documentation.html#col_com
You will need to perform the ALTER TABLE step yourself.
