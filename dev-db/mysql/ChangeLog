*mysql-3.23.51 (22 June 2002)

  22 June 2002; Donny Davies <woodchip@gentoo.org> :

  Update to latest stable release; 3.23.51.
  - Important!  On >=gentoo-1.3, the bundled 3.2.9a bezerkeley db will be
    built if you have USE berkdb.  On <gentoo-1.3, the sys-libs/db-3.2.9
    system version is used.
  - added a small patch for tcpd; looks like an upstream bug?
  - sync the compiler flags with their "official" spec ;)
  - cleaned up the ebuild a little.

  Made sure that mysql compiled on gentoo 1.3+ as well, where db 4.0.14 is 
  the default... Stayed off 3.23.50, whoever updates mysql next, please 
  take my changes here in account as well plz
