# MonetDB must be started with a startup script which tells it what
# to do.  Most users will not want to change this startup script
# as it loads the SQL, XQuery (pathfinder) and Mapi modules which
# allow for SQL, XQuery and MIL connections.
# If you have special demands, point this variable to your own script
# which contains the desired commands.
# Note: for security reasons by default all listening connections are
# bound to 127.0.0.1.  If you need connections to be bound at 0.0.0.0
# have a look at the default startup script to enable this.
