		MonetDB is a main-memory database developed at CWI, the
		Netherlands.  The main-memory focus of the database has resulted
		in a column based way of dealing with relational tables.  Due to
		this unconventional approach, MonetDB can be a very fast
		database for complex queries, and as such in use (and perfectly
		suitable) for intensive data-mining tasks.
