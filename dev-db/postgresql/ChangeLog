*postgresql-7.2-r2 (10 Apr 2002)

  10 Apr 2002; Karl Trygve Kalleberg <karltk@gentoo.org> postgresql-7.2-r2.ebuild files/digest-postgresql-7.2-r2:

  Added proper code in pkg_setup() so that it will refuse to compile if the
  user has JDK 1.4.0 as his system VM.

  Removed postgresql-7.2-r1.ebuild files/digest-postgresql-7.2-r1

*postgresql-7.2-r1 (18 Feb 2002)

  18 Feb 2002; Karl Trygve Kalleberg <karltk@gentoo.org> postgresql-7.2-r1.ebuild files/digest-postgresql-7.2-r1:

  Now requires a jdk-1.3 instead of >=1.3, as 1.4 blows up when compiling.

*postgresql-7.2 (15 Feb 2002)

  15 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> postgresql-7.2.ebuild ,
  files/postgresql-7.2-dyn-libperl-gentoo.diff files/digest-postgresql-7.2:
  Upgraded to version 7.2. Python now also works with python 2.2 and there
  are less patches needed to make the perl install go smoothly ... nice :-)

*postgresql-7.1.3-r4 (5 Feb 2002)

  5 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> postgresql-7.1.3-r4.ebuild :
  Changed data dirs to use a fixed path instead of determining it from the
  package name. Also added a binary compatibility slot. Changed data dir to
  /var/lib/postgresql/data to follow what has been done by the mysql ebuild.

  5 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> files/7.1.3/postgresql :
  Fixed wrong data dir in init script.

*postgresql-7.1.3-r3 (1 Feb 2002)

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
  
  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
