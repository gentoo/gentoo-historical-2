  21 Apr 2005; Simon Stelling <blubb@gentoo.org> sqsh-2.1-r1.ebuild:
  stable on amd64

*sqsh-2.1.3-r1 (11 Apr 2005)

  11 Apr 2005; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> +sqsh-2.1.3-r1.ebuild:
  Added patches from the new maintainer-by-proxy Richard Brown
  <mynamewasgone@gmail.com> in bug #88343. These patches make the build system
  a little saner, by recognising the difference between --with and --without
  for motif. Additionally, he did a nice patch to make it obey mandir like
  every other good package, and specify that the rc file goes into sysconfdir,
  like every other good package.

*sqsh-2.1.3 (06 Apr 2005)

  06 Apr 2005; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> sqsh-2.1-r1.ebuild,
  +sqsh-2.1.3.ebuild:
  more cleanups, and version bump thanks to: Richard Brown
  <mynamewasgone@gmail.com> in bug #87243  Now, by the way, upstream (whoever
  the hell they are) should invest an hour or two figuring out how to use the
  autotools properly.  Possibly, if I'm steaming about this a little later on
  this week/month, I'll fix it up a bit, but damn.

  06 Apr 2005; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> -files/config.patch,
  sqsh-2.1-r1.ebuild:

  Brown <mynamewasgone@gmail.com>"

  22 Sep 2003; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> sqsh-2.1-r1.ebuild,
  files/config.patch:

  connect to a sybase database. Thanks much to: chris strom
  <cstrom@speakeasy.net> in bug #28526

  Had to patch src/config.h with a config.h from sqsh-1.7; configure is broken.
