tangogps is an easy to use, fast and lightweight mapping application for use with or without GPS.

By default tangoGPS uses map data from the Openstreetmap project. Additionally a variety of other repositories can be easily added. 

The maps are automagically downloaded and cached for offline use while you drag
or zoom the map. Furthermore you can conveniently pre-cache areas with
tangoGPS.
