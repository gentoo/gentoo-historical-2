    Marble is a generic geographical map widget that is meant to be used by KDE4
	applications. It shows the earth as a sphere but doesn't make use of any
	hardware acceleration (no OpenGL). So although it might look similar to
	professional applications like Google Earth or Nasa World Wind it's rather
	meant to be a small light weight multi purpose widget.
