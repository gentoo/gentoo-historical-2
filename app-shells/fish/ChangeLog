  Bump. Better error messages for sh-style syntax that doesn't work in fish.
  Also, don't execute command if wildcard expands to nothing.

  Add dep on sys-devel/bc, reported by user via upstream.

  06 Dec 2005; Donnie Berkholz <spyderous@gentoo.org>; fish-1.17.0.ebuild:
  Force the install on, because portage apparently stopped doing it by default
  at some point.

  05 Dec 2005; Donnie Berkholz <spyderous@gentoo.org>; +metadata.xml,

  The Friendly Interactive SHell. Has command-line syntax highlighting, tab
  completion by default, 'open' to use .desktop files for opening any type of
  file, and other cool stuff.
