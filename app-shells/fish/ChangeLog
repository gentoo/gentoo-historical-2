  18 Jan 2007; Donnie Berkholz <dberkholz@gentoo.org>; +fish-1.22.2.ebuild:
  (#161476) Bump. (#151900) Install to /bin so it's usable as a default shell
  when /usr is unavailable. Still needs an entry in /etc/shells, though. Use
  emake for install instead of make, so MAKEOPTS gets passed through. Seems to
  work fine in parallel.
