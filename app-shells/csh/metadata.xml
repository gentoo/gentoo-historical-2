<longdescription>
The Unix command-line interpreter shell and script language by William Joy, 
originating from Berkeley Unix.

Unix systems up to around Unix Version 7 only had one shell - the Bourne shell, sh. 
Csh had better interactive features, notably command input history, allowing earlier 
commands to be recalled and edited. 

This version of csh was ported from the current release of NetBSD to Linux for the
Gentoo project.
