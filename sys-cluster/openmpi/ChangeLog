  Can't do that with new-style virtuals, block on other providers instead.

  (#153968) Bump. Interesting changes include correctness and performance
  fixes for heterogenous nodes as well as TCP updates to support non-uniform
  TCP environments. More info at

*openmpi-1.1.1 (25 Sep 2006)

  25 Sep 2006; Donnie Berkholz <dberkholz@gentoo.org>; +metadata.xml,
  +openmpi-1.1.1.ebuild:
  (#126295) Add Open MPI ebuild from the science overlay (Sebastien Fabbro,
  Eric Thibodeau). I removed the compiler-based slotting mechanism because
  portage lacks support for multiple slots of the same version -- the SLOT
  file in /var/db/pkg just gets overwritten and it loses track of the others,
  amongst other issues. Removed USE=static, that's used to compile static
  binaries, not to also build static libraries. Changed SLOT to 0 from 6 in
  the overlay. Removed the hack for PGI compilers, that needs to happen in
  fortran.eclass. Use epause() from eutils.eclass rather than sleep.
