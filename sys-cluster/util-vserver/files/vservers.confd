# A space-delimited list of vserver MARKS to start. 
# Identification of vservers happens by
# putting the flavor into /etc/vservers/<vserver-id>/apps/init/mark.
MARKS="default"

# Wether to start all vservers by default (supersedes MARKS)
# This will be enabled if STARTALL is set regardless of its content
# i.e. you have to comment to disable it
#STARTALL=yes

# Wether to stop all vservers by default (supersedes MARKS)
# This will be enabled if STOPALL is set regardless of its content
# i.e. you have to comment to disable it
STOPALL=yes

# Number of vservers which shall be started in parallel; since most
# initmethods are spending much time in sleeps, it is safe to
# use a high number here, though you should pay attention if you make 
# use of depends in /etc/vservers as some services may not be up if
# started in parallel
#NUMPARALLEL=6

# The name of the vserver lock directory which is used by the init script
# to determine which MARKS have already been started (used within
# vstatus() to show the status of MARKS). Default should be good
# for everyone. Change at your own risk
#LOCKDIR=/var/lock/vservers

# The location of util-vserver-vars
# This file contains variables to util-vserver scripts used within the
# init script. Change at your own risk.
