  13 Jul 2006; Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org> mpich2-1.0.3-r1.ebuild:
  Mark 1.0.3-r1 ~ia64. #133999

  12 Jul 2006; Steve Arnold <nerdboy@gentoo.org> mpich2-1.0.3.ebuild:
  Backported patches and install fixes to 1.0.3, but no other changes,
  since something rather subtle broke the hdf5 configure against 1.0.3-r1
  (but 1.0.3 relies heavily on configure detection for things like fortran
  support and doesn't yet have a test section).  Also added thread support.

  12 Jul 2006; Steve Arnold <nerdboy@gentoo.org>
  files/mpich2-1.0.3-soname.patch, mpich2-1.0.3-r1.ebuild:
  Finally killed the soname bug, added some additional configure options,
  and made libaio a dependency for romio support (also fixed libaio).

  28 Jun 2006; Steve Arnold <nerdboy@gentoo.org> mpich2-1.0.3-r1.ebuild:
  reverted to original (and standard) library location

*mpich2-1.0.3-r1 (26 Jun 2006)

  26 Jun 2006; Steve Arnold <nerdboy@gentoo.org>
  +files/mpich2-1.0.3-make-test.patch,
  +files/mpich2-1.0.3-mpe-install.patch, +files/mpd.conf,
  +mpich2-1.0.3-r1.ebuild:
  Added explicit fortran and mpe-sdk support, test section, although
  tests still have a build issue with portage (only manual builds are
  currently working).  Feel free to add magic...

  25 Jun 2006; Markus Rothe <corsair@gentoo.org> mpich2-1.0.3.ebuild:
  Stable on ppc64; bug #133999

  17 Jun 2006; Jason Wever <weeve@gentoo.org> mpich2-1.0.3.ebuild:
  Added ~sparc keyword wrt bug #133999.

  25 May 2006; Steve Arnold <nerdboy@gentoo.org> mpich2-1.0.3.ebuild:
  Early stable bump for gdal (required).

  21 May 2006; Steve Arnold <nerdboy@gentoo.org> mpich2-1.0.3.ebuild:
  Keyworded and tested on ppc, and as the older mpich was previously
  keyworded for both ppc and ppc64, I added them both back in.

*mpich2-1.0.3 (21 May 2006)

  21 May 2006; Steve Arnold <nerdboy@gentoo.org>
  +files/mpich2-1.0.3-make.patch, +files/mpich2-1.0.3-soname.patch,
  +mpich2-1.0.3.ebuild:
  Updated to new version (bug 125754) with patches; needed some help to
  create shared libs properly, along with some DESTDIR fixes (required for
  HDF5 dep, as virtual/mpi was barfing).

*mpich2-1.0.2_p1 (27 Dec 2005)

  27 Dec 2005; Joel Martin <kanaka@gentoo.org> +metadata.xml,
  +mpich2-1.0.2_p1.ebuild:
  Create mpich2 ebuild for version 1.0.2-p1
