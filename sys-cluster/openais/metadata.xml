The OpenAIS Standards Based Cluster Framework is an OSI Certified
implementation of the Service Availability Forum Application Interface
Specification (AIS). Other cluster APIs are also available for developer use.

The Application Interface Specification is a software API and policies which
are used to develop applications that maintain service during faults.
Restarting and failover of applications is also provided for those deploying
applications which may not be modified.

The OpenAIS software is designed to allow any third party to implement plugin
cluster services using the infrastructure provided.
