*trswm-0.4.9 (05 Nov 2003)

  05 Nov 2003; Mike Gardiner <obz@gentoo.org> trswm-0.4.9.ebuild, files/trswm:
  New version, 0.4.9, with re-written ebuild. Includes a wrapper script to
  handle per user configuration, in place of the trswm binary which is now
  trswm.bin. trswm --help should give more information on it's usage, and it is
  a complete launcher, so adding exec trswm to ~/.xinitrc is all that's 
  required to launch trswm.

*trswm-0.3 (17 Jun 2003)

  17 Jun 2003; Tom Payne <twp@gentoo.org> trswm-0.3.ebuild :
  Initial release.
