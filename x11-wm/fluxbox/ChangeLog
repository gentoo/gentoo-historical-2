  files/digest-fluxbox-0.1.8 :

  Version bump to newest stable

*fluxbox-0.1.7-r3 (20 Mar 200)

  20 Mar 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> fluxbox-0.1.7-r3.ebuild :

  Removed gnome and kde from the deps, because they are NOT required in order
  to compile support for them.  The KDE support is meaningless without KDE 
  installed, but it is harmless and leads to less bloat if KDE wasn't intended
  to be installed in the first place.

*fluxbox-0.1.7-r3 (15 Mar 2002)

  16 Mar 2002; Karl Trygve Kalleberg <karltk@gentoo.org> fluxbox-0.1.7-r3.ebuild :

  Added /etc/X11/Sessions/fluxbox pointer. Didn't bother updating revision 
  as the fix is so small.

  Removed old revisions.

*fluxbox-0.1.7-r3 (15 Mar 2002)

  15 Mar 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> fluxbox-0.1.7-r3.ebuild :

  This package now provides virtual/fluxbox, so as to allow blackbox
  applications (which are completely compatible with fluxbox) to run without
  having to emerge blackbox as well.

*fluxbox-0.1.7-r1 (9 Mar 2002)

  9 Mar 2002; Karl Trygve Kalleberg <karltk@gentoo.org> fluxbox-0.1.7-r2.ebuild :

  session list in kdm and gdm.

*fluxbox-0.1.6 (1 Feb 2002)

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
  
  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
