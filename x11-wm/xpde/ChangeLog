*xpde-0.1.1 (07 Dec 2002)

  07 Dec 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> xpde-0.1.1.ebuild
  ChangeLog files/digest-xpde-0.1.1 :

  New desktop environment designed to look and feel like WindowsXP.  Since
  they now have designed their own window manager instead of dressing up
  metacity, it is added into portage.  Be warned that the functionality is
  limited at best.
