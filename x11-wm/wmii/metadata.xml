		wmii is a highly customizable keyboard- and mouse-driven X11 window
		manager which supports conventional, tabbed and tiled window management
		with low memory usage and a vi-alike user interaction. Due to a complete
		rewrite it is highly modularized and uses a new configuration and
		inter-process communication interface which is oriented on the 9p
		protocol of the plan9 operating system.
