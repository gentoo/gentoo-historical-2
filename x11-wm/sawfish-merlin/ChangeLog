*sawfish-merlin-1.0.1 (17 Feb 2002)

  17 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> :
  
  Seperate package to install the sawfish merlin patches. The required config
  files for every user have been installed to /etc/skel. Already existing
  users should copy .sawfishrc and .sawfish from /etc/skel to their home
  directory before being able to use these merlin extensions.
