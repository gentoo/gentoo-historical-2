  windowmaker-0.80.2-r4.ebuild, files/wmfpo.patch, 
  files/gtk2flickerfix.patch:
  A new release of WindowMaker coming from upstream cvs will be real 
  soon now but these two updates are very nice.  Pretty soon
  windowmaker will be more popular than gnome and kde combined! muhaha!
  GTK+2 applications should no longer fight for focus and the wmfpo patch
  adds options in WPrefs.app for single-click window raising and window 
  maximizing instead of shading.  Thanks to bug submitters and testers 
  on #38481 and #49804.
