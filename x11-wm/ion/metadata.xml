	Ion is a tiling (no overlapping windows) window manager that also has 
	PWM-style tabbed frames which can contain multiple client windows. These 
	features help keeping windows organized and quickly switching between 
	them. Ion was designed primarily as an efficient and unobtrusive window 
	manager for users who prefer the keyboard.
