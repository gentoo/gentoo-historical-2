*openbox-2.2.2 (08 Dec 2002)

  08 Dec 2002; Matt Keadle <mkeadle@gentoo.org> openbox-2.2.2.ebuild
  files/digest-openbox-2.2.2

  Bumped to latest devel release

*openbox-2.1.3-r2 (08 Dec 2002)

  08 Dec 2002; Matt Keadle <mkeadle@gentoo.org> openbox-2.1.3-r2.ebuild
  files/digest-openbox-2.1.3-r2

  Repared so xftlsfonts gets built instead of being stripped out.

*openbox-2.2.1-r2 (08 Dec 2002)

  08 Dec 2002; Matt Keadle <mkeadle@gentoo.org> openbox-2.2.1-r2.ebuild
  files/digest-openbox-2.2.1-r2

  Fixed so that you don't lose antialiase text if you have Xft2 installed.

*openbox-2.2.1-r1 (25 Nov 2002)

  25 Nov 2002; Matt Keadle <mkeadle@gentoo.org> openbox-2.2.1-r1.ebuild
  files/digest-openbox-2.2.1-r1

  Cleaned out some unneeded empty directories and fixed so the button
  .xbm files were actually installed. At the moment, Openbox is the
  only *box that can use pixmaps as buttons, and the styles contained
  in commonbox-styles are not setup to use those pixmaps. New
  commonbox-styles release is forthcoming.

*openbox-2.1.3-r1 (25 Nov 2002)

  25 Nov 2002; Matt Keadle <mkeadle@gentoo.org> openbox-2.1.3-r1.ebuild
  files/digest-openbox-2.1.3-r1

  Fixes so NLS catalogs actually get installed to /usr/share/locale.
  They were not being installed at all before. A default epistrc file
  is now placed as /usr/share/commonbox/epistrc.default

  Removed installation of the xftlsfonts man page, since the xftlsfonts
  program is not currently being installed due to Xft2 issues.

*openbox-2.2.1 (20 Nov 2002)

  20 Nov 2002; Matt Keadle <mkeadle@gentoo.org> openbox-2.2.1.ebuild
  files/digest-openbox-2.2.1

  Version bump to latest development release. It starting to get interesting
  with Xft1/2. Fluxbox is now making use of Xft for antialiased text.
  However, fluxbox and openbox and using opposing versions of Xft.
  Currently our xft (2.x) ebuild is masked, which openbox needs/want. I can
  do some sedding to remove the compilation to utils/xftlsfonts but that
  can't become even a semi-permanent fix.
