  19 Mar 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> enlightenment-0.16.5-r4.ebuild :
  There was an issue where the path to the enlightenment binary was not being 
  put into englightenment.install script.  The Makefile in scripts/ should have
  done that, but it didn't resolve the name correctly.  So, this has been
  adjusted to make the script work.

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
  
  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
