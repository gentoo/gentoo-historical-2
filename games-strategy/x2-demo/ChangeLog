  -x2-demo-1.4.03.ebuild:
  Cleaning out the older ebuild since it won't work properly, anyway, and
  upstream sucks by not versioning their downloads.

*x2-demo-1.4.05 (15 Sep 2007)

  15 Sep 2007; Chris Gianelloni <wolf31o2@gentoo.org>
  +x2-demo-1.4.05.ebuild:
  Version bump to 1.4.05 and closing bug #181265.

*x2-demo-1.4.03 (12 Dec 2006)

  12 Dec 2006; Chris Gianelloni <wolf31o2@gentoo.org>
  -x2-demo-1.4.01.ebuild, +x2-demo-1.4.03.ebuild:
  Version bump. Unfortunately, upstream sucks and doesn't bother putting
  versions in their packaging. Because of this, we aren't mirroring this on
  our mirrors. Closing bug #157294.

  06 Dec 2006; Chris Gianelloni <wolf31o2@gentoo.org> x2-demo-1.4.01.ebuild:
  Remove old virtual/x11 dependency.

  +x2-demo-1.4.01.ebuild:
  Initial import. Ebuild by Paul Bredbury <brebs@sent.com> and modified by me.
  Closing bug #132286.
