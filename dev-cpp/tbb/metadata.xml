  The Intel Threading Building Blocks is a library that helps you
  leverage multi-core processor performance without having to be a
  threading expert. It represents a higher-level, task-based
  parallelism that abstracts platform details and threading mechanism
  for performance and scalability.

  it seemed to be more stable and with as many features as the stable
