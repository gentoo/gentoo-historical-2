.TH elogviewer 1 "October 07, 2006" "elogviewer -- An interface to Portage's ELOG system"

.SH NAME
elogviewer \-\- a program to easily manage elog files created by Portage during emerge

.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page explains the
.B elogviewer
program. This program lists all elogs created during emerges of
packages from Portage, the package manager of Gentoo Linux.  So all
warnings or informational messages generated during an update can be
reviewed at one glance.

.SH USAGE

To generate elogs, the user needs to tell Portage to activate the
saving features for the ELOG facilities in his /etc/make.conf file via
the line

.RS 4
PORTAGE_ELOG_SYSTEM="save"
.RE

and choose at least one out of

.RS 4
PORTAGE_ELOG_CLASSES="warn info error log"
.RE

Further prerequisite is the elog directory (in most cases
/var/log/portage/elog/, see variable PORT_LOGDIR), which may need to
be created and belong to the portage group. If the user wants to start
the program as non-root, he needs to add himself to portage group.
For more information on the ELOG system, see /etc/make.conf.example.

The program allows to select the ebuild functions in which to look for
messages, so unpack messages about patching can be disabled while
still having warnings from the post installation function without
informational messages.  elogs can be deleted individually or all in
one step.
