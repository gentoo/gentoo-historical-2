*esearch-0.4.0 (19 Sep 2003)

  19 Sep 2003; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> esearch-0.4.0.ebuild:
  new package which speeds up portage searching. David Peter
  <shark@phpwelt.com> wrote this and submitted in bug #26532.  It should be
  part of gentoolkit, I suppose, but it works fantastically stand-alone.  To
  use it, please use eupdatedb regularly, and then esearch instead of
  "emerge search" and esearch -S instead of "emerge -S"
