  01 May 2005; Michael Cummings <mcummings@gentoo.org> g-cpan-0.12.ebuild:
  Resetting keywords to match that of portage since Digest::MD5 isn't really a
  dep, just a short cut optional

*g-cpan-0.12 (30 Apr 2005)

  30 Apr 2005; Michael Cummings <mcummings@gentoo.org> +metadata.xml,
  +g-cpan-0.12.ebuild:
  Initial import. Previously this package has lived inside the portage
  tarball, but with a growing need to be able to push out changes quickly, we
  can no longer afford for it to be tied to the development schedule of
  portage (that and the portage devs don't like being asked hourly when the
  next release of portage is going out just because I have a change in
  g-cpan). Since until this point g-cpan has gone out with portage, which 
  is keyworded for absolutely everything, I've imported the keywords for 
  Digest::MD5, which for the time being we will make a dep. For those interested
  in helping with g-cpan, send email to perl@gentoo.org or mcummings@gentoo.org.
  I'd like to get rid of the dep on a configured CPAN :)
