  02 Jun 2003; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> lib-compat-1.2.ebuild :
  version bump. The x86 part now contains libstdc++.so.2.9 as well, which is

  sparc, alpha and ppc

  19 Dec 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> lib-compat-1.1.ebuild :

  granted, it's only been a day, but the tests for this have been coming in
  very positively -- and many of them -- so moving to stable.

  18 Dec 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> lib-compat-1.1.ebuild
  files/digest-lib-compat-1.1 :

  Added the libstdc++ from gcc-2.95.3

*lib-compat-1.0-r2 (1 Feb 2002)

  06 Dec 2002; Rodney Rees <manson@gentoo.org> : changed sparc ~sparc keywords
 
  07 Sep 2002; Mark Guertin <gerk@gentoo.org> lib-compat-1.0-r2 :
  set x86 USE on SRC_URI and src_install function, these are not valid
  on ppc or sparc (x86 libs), but may need to add ppc libs in future so 
  left it as a stub build for future usage

  15 Jul 2002; Mark Guertin <gerk@gentoo.org>
  Added ppc to keywords

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
  
  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
