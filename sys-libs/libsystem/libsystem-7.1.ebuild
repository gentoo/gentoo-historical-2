# I haven't listed any deps here, we're currently not building Darwin from scratch yet.
# For now, this is a dummy package provided upstream. The version provided by the
# distributor is pinpointed in the users profile. I am not going to be injecting this 
# because its the root of the dependency tree. I'm not comfortable with portage
# having an injected, non-existant package as the root of its tree.
