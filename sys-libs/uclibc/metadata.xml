uClibc pronounced yew-see-lib-see is a C library for developing embedded Linux 
systems. It is much smaller than the GNU C Library, but nearly all applications supported 
by glibc also work perfectly with uClibc. Porting applications from glibc to uClibc 
typically involves just recompiling the source code. uClibc even supports shared libraries 
and threading. It currently runs on standard Linux and MMU-less (also known as uClinux) 
systems with support for alpha, ARM, cris, i386, i960, h8300, m68k, mips/mipsel, PowerPC, 
SH, SPARC, and v850 processors.
