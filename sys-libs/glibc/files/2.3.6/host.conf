# The  file /etc/host.conf contains configuration information specific to
# the resolver library.  It should contain one configuration keyword  per
# line,  followed by appropriate configuration information.  The keywords
# recognized are order, trim, mdns, multi, nospoof, spoof, and reorder.



# This keyword specifies how host lookups are to be performed. It
# should be followed by one or more lookup methods, separated by
# commas.  Valid methods are bind, hosts, and nis.
#
order hosts, bind


# Valid  values are on and off.  If set to on, the resolv+ library
# will return all valid addresses for a host that appears  in  the
# /etc/hosts  file,  instead  of  only  the first.  This is off by
# default, as it may cause a substantial performance loss at sites
# with large hosts files.
#
multi off
