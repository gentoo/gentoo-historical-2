*glibc-2.2.5-r1 (15 Feb 2002)

  15 Feb 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org>: Added tweaked version of
  Brandon Low's patch that ensures that library symlinks are installed *after*
  (not before) the actual libraries are installed.  This should fix glibc merge
  deaths, but we need a generic solution to solve this problem.  This should
  close bug #695.  Filing a new bug for adding this functionality to Portage.

*glibc-2.2.5 (10 Feb 2002)

  10 Feb 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org>:  New glibc release for testing
  only.  Masked.

*glibc-2.2.4-r9 (1 Feb 2002)

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
  
  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
