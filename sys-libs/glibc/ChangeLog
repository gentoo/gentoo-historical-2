*glibc-2.2.5-r7 (03 Aug 2002)

  03 Aug 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> glibc-2.2.5-r7.ebuild :

  Add the patch for fixing the segfaults in mutt, etc while sandbox is
  running back in.  Seems the relocation problems was also a cause of
  the atexit() bug, and fixed in gcc-2.95.3-r7 and later.

*glibc-2.2.5-r6 (02 Aug 2002)

  02 Aug 2002; Daniel Ahlberg <aliz@gentoo.org>
  Added patch for sunrpc overflow.

*glibc-2.2.5-r5 (14 Jul 2002)

  15 Jul 2002; Mark Guertin <gerk@gentoo.org>
  Added ppc to keywords

  14 Jul 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> glibc-2.2.5-r5.ebuild :

  A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in multiple implementations of DNS
  resolver libraries.  This affects glibc-2.2.5 and earlier.   See bug #4923
  and:

    http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2002-19.html

  for details.

  Seems gcc-3.1.1 is even more strict than 3.1 .. patch glibc for gcc-3.1.1.
  This is also correct for previous gcc versions.

*glibc-2.2.5-r4 (5 June 2002)

  5 June 2002; Bart Verwilst <verwilst@gentoo.org> glibc-2.2.5-r4.ebuild :

  Added gcc3.1/binutils 2.12 patch, wich solves the nvidia-glx package, 
  amongst others... (__divdi3 stuff)
  Update: Filtered -malign-double out of the ebuild as well now, because 
  it b0rks glibc.
  

  13 Apr 2002; M.Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> glibc-2.2.5-r2.ebuild :

  Try to fix the pkg_postinst() and /etc/localtime issue sanely.  It just
  newking my /etc/localtime with a symlink was starting to get irritating.

*glibc-2.2.5-r3 (03 Apr 2002)

  03 Apr 2002; Geert Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> glibc-2.2.5-r3.ebuild,
  files/digest-glibc-2.2.5-r3, files/glibc-2.2.5-sandbox.diff :
  
  Added patch that fixes an ld.so.preload bug which made calls after freopen()
  segfault. This now works correctly. This closes bug #501
   
*glibc-2.2.5-r1 (15 Feb 2002)

  15 Feb 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org>: Added tweaked version of
  Brandon Low's patch that ensures that library symlinks are installed *after*
  (not before) the actual libraries are installed.  This should fix glibc merge
  deaths, but we need a generic solution to solve this problem.  This should
  close bug #695.  Filing a new bug for adding this functionality to Portage.

*glibc-2.2.5 (10 Feb 2002)

  10 Feb 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org>:  New glibc release for testing
  only.  Masked.

*glibc-2.2.4-r9 (1 Feb 2002)

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
  
  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
