*libutempter-1.1.2.1 (13 May 2005)

  13 May 2005; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org>
  +libutempter-1.1.2.1.ebuild:
  New package as a replacement for sys-apps/utempter. This seems to be the
  package we will move to as the preferred utempter, as it works better for
  freebsd, and also mike harris of redhat/freedesktop is rumoured to be
  rejumping the development of this.  At any rate, at least Flameeyes will
  be happy.
