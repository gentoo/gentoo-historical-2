  21 Mar 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> db-3.2.3h-r4.ebuild :

  HTML documentation will no longer get gzipped -- but too small a change
  to warrant having the users remerge this.  Thanks so stefan@mdy.univie.ac.at 
  for the bug.

  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
