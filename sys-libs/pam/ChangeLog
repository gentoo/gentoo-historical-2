  08 Jan 2003; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> pam-0.75-r11.ebuild :
  Mark stable.

*pam-0.75-r11 (25 Dec 2002)

  07 Jan 2003; Martin Holzer <mholzer@gentoo.org> pam-0.75-r11.ebuild :
  Corrected Homepage.

  25 Dec 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> pam-0.75-r11.ebuild :

  Add pam-0.75-pam_console_apply-use-correct-device.patch.bz2 to fix a
  problem where pam_console_apply and co did not use the correct device
  if devfsd was not used, closing bug #12207.  The patch was created by
  Sam Yates <sam@quux.dropbear.id.au>.

  16 Dec 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> pam-0.75-r10.ebuild :

  Change DEPEND to only depend on db3 or greater, per request from Donny ...
  this is for db4 support in future ...

  06 Dec 2002; Rodney Rees <manson@gentoo.org> : changed sparc ~sparc keywords
 
  05 Dec 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> pam-0.75-r10.ebuild :

  Fix bison syntax for bison-1.50 or later, thanks to Redhat.  Added
  pam-0.75-pam_console-bison.fixes.patch for this.

  26 Oct 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> pam-0.75-r10.ebuild :

  Add pam-0.75-pam_userdb-use-db3.patch to get pam_userdb to link to
  db3 or db4 if present, rather than libndbm, as that causes unresolved
  symbols.

*pam-0.75-r10 (26 Oct 2002)

  26 Oct 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> pam-0.75-r10.ebuild :

  Generate the linker scripts in /usr/lib to fix bug #4411.

*pam-0.75-r9 (24 Oct 2002)

  24 Oct 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> pam-0.75-r9.ebuild :

  Another snag in the problem with gcc3 linking static libs in /usr/lib
  before dynamic ones in /lib (bug #4411).  Seems like c++ stuff do not
  link properly with libpam.so, but rather with libpam.a, and as pam
  must be dynamic to load its modules, it breaks auth for a few critical
  things (like gdm and kdm).  This is not tested, but the urgency demands
  a solution.  This release just do not install static libs for pam until
  the gcc/binutils issue can be resolved.

*pam-0.75-r8 (13 Oct 2002)

  13 Oct 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> pam-0.75-r8.ebuild :

  Add pam-0.75-pam_console-fix-fullpath-in-file-classes.patch to fix a small
  compat problem between pam-login and pam_console.so.  pam_console.so expects
  PAM_TTY to be set by login without prefixing "/dev/" it seems, which
  pam-login did.  This should close bug #6612.

  Synced with Mandrake and Redhat for latest patches.

  05 Aug 2002; M.Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> ${P}-pam_group-confile.patch :
  Fixes the config file location of pam_group.so.  This resolves bug #6010.

  31 Jul 2002; M.Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> ${P}-pam_wheel-segfault.patch :
  Fix a segfault in pam_wheel.so if "use_uid" was not given as parameter.
  This resolves bug #5686.

*pam-0.75-r7 (31 Jul 2002)

  31 Jul 2002; M.Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> pam-0.75-r7.ebuild :
  Update some patches.  Ebuild cleanups, as well as some compiler
  fixes.


  15 Jul 2002; Mark Guertin <gerk@gentoo.org>
  Added ppc to keywords

  11 Apr 2002; Spider <spider@gentoo.org>
  Update all glib dependencies to use glib-1.2*  in preparation of unmasking the glib-2.0.1 packages


  04 Apr 2002; M.Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> pam-0.75-r6.ebuild :

  Add module build checking back as we do not want some module to 
  silently fail and lock the user out of his system.

*pam-0.75-r6 (04 Apr 2002)

  04 Apr 2002; Jared H. Hudson <jhhudso@gentoo.org> pam-0.75-r6.ebuild :

  item.

*pam-0.75-r5 (03 Apr 2002)

  03 Apr 2002; Geert Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> pam-0.75-r5.ebuild :
