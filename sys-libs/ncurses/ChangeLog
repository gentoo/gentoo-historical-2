*ncurses-5.2-r7 (26 Oct 2002)
*ncurses-5.2.20020511-r3 (26 Oct 2002)
*ncurses-5.3-r1 (26 Oct 2002)

  10 Nov 2002; Nick Hadaway <raker@gentoo.org> ncurses-5.3-r1.ebuild :
  Marked unstable and unmasking.

  26 Oct 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> ncurses*.ebuild :
  Add linker scripts in /usr/lib to fix bug #4411.

*ncurses-5.3 (17 Oct 2002)

  23 Oct 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> ncurses-5.3.ebuild :
  
  Because ncurses-5.3 have c++ bindings, we cannot enable them during
  bootstrap.  Thus disable it if "build" or "bootstrap" in USE, and
  then get bootstrap.sh to rebuild it afterwards without those flags.
  Also fix a problem where old build images had ncurses-5.2 libs, which
  did not get removed.

  17 Oct 2002; Nick Hadaway <raker@gentoo.org> ncurses-5.3.ebuild,
  files/digest-ncurses-5.3 :
  New version of ncurses.  Many years worth of fixes culminating to a
  new release.

*ncurses-5.2.20020511-r2 (3 Sep 2002)
*ncurses-5.2-r6 (3 Sep 2002)

  3 Sep 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> ncurses-5.2.20020511-r2,
                                                   ncurses-5.2-r6 :
  
  Change --enable-termcap to --disable-termcap.  This fixes the starup
  problems in screen with the presence of /etc/termcap.  This should
  close bug #7060.  NOTE: remerge screen after ncurses update.

*ncurses-5.2.20020511-r1 (9 Jun 2002)
	
  31 Jul 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> :

  the second gcc-3.1 patch (from files/) attempts to replace lines in the
  cursesw.cc file that do not even exist any longer.  the patch fails.  It
  has been commented out, with the hope that whoever generated it for the
  older snapshots will investigate and sort this out.  ncurses, it must be
  noted, appears to work well in production, despite the failed patch,
  anyway.

  24 Jul 2002; Spider <spider@gentoo.org> :
  change CXXFLAGS in the ebuild to accomodate for -fno-exceptions

  15 Jul 2002; Mark Guertin <gerk@gentoo.org>
  Added ppc to keywords

  26 June 2002; mark Guertin <gerk@gentoo.org> :

  changed bzcat to bunzip2 -c (bzcat doesn't exist until
  building bzip2 outside of USE="build" so this broke
  building stage1)

  9 Jun 2002; Dan Armak <danarmak@gentoo.org> :
  
  Add bzip2 as a dep so that said patch, which is compressed, can be applied.

*ncurses-5.2.20020511-r1 (26 May 2002)

  26 May 2002; Preston A. Elder <prez@gentoo.org> :

  Added patch to make it work with gcc 3.1

*ncurses-5.2.20020511 (18 May 2002)

  18 May 2002; Donny Davies <woodchip@gentoo.org> :

  New snapshot for gcc-3.x testing.

*ncurses-5.2.20020112a-r1 (205 Apr 2002)

  05 Apr 2002; Geert Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> :

  Small header file fix to make apps that use ncurses compile correctly with gcc3.
	
*ncurses-5.2.20020112a (21 Mar 2002)

  21 Mar 2002; Grant Goodyear <g2boojum@gentoo.org> :

  New version that compiles w/ gcc3.
	
*ncurses-5.2-r5 (21 Mar 2002)
  04 Aug 2002; Spider <spider@gentoo.org> ncurses-5.2-r5.ebuild :
  filter out -fno-exceptions from this build as well.
  
  12 Mar 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> ncurses-5.2-r5.ebuild :
	
  stefan@mdy.univie.ac.at pointed out html documentation getting gzipped
  unnecessarily.  This is now fixed in r5.  I noticed a prior r4 which does
  not work anyway, so this is based off r3.

*ncurses-5.2-r3 (1 Feb 2002)

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
  
  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
