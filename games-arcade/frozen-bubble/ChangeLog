*frozen-bubble-1.0.0-r1 (01 Jun 2003)

  03 Jun 2003; <msterret@gentoo.org> frozen-bubble-1.0.0-r1.ebuild:
  Switched from using Makefile.fixed in files/ to just modifying the Makefile
  from the source distribution.  Uses sed -i so added sed to DEPEND.

  02 Jun 2003; <msterret@gentoo.org> frozen-bubble-1.0.0-r1.ebuild:
  Removed the seding of frozen-bubble since it seems to no longer be needed.
  There is no fb.pl in the source distribution or the installed package and
  fb.pl isn't mentioned in frozen-bubble so the sed has been silently doing
  nothing for a while.

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> skel.ChangeLog :
  
  This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the comments should be
  well explained and written in clean English. 
  
  Every new version or revision of the package has to be marked by a '*'
  separator line as above. Changements since the last revision have to be
  added to the top of the file, underneath the initial copyright and cvs header
  comments, in exactly the same format as this comment.
  
  This means that you start with header line that has the following format :
  
      date; your_name <your_email> changed_file1, changed_file2 :
	  
  Below that line your explanation should follow. It has to be indented,
  paragraphed and wrapped at a linewidth of 80 characters.
  
  Any details about what exactly changed in the code should be added as a
  message when the changes are committed to cvs, not in this file.
