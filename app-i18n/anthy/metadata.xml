  <description>I created the ebuild to test app-i18n/uim but I'm not a
  full Anthy user at the moment, so I'd like someone to help testing
  and managing these ebuilds (especially anthy-ss stuff).

Anthy is a free and secure Japanese kana-kanji server.  This ebuild
includes cannadic as a server-side dictionary, so you don't need any
extra package to run it.  You can use anthy with app-i18n/jmode (XIM),
app-i18n/uim(XIM, GTK+ immodule) and emacs (to enable Anthy support
for emacs, build this package with emacs USE flag).
