  IM-JA is a Japanese input module for GTK+2. It supports kanji
  conversion using either the Canna or the (Free)Wnn kanji conversion
  engine. IM-JA can also do kanji character recognition, you can draw
  kanji into a widget using the mouse. This feature is based on the
  KanjiPad application which has been enhanced in IM-JA.
