Quote from Jam less homepage (http://www.io.com/~kazushi/less/):
&quot;Less is one of the best text viewer. It is a successor of more. It
allows you to scroll forward, scroll backward, search, etc through
multiple text files.

However, it doesn't support multi bytes characters. So, I made a patch
to enhance it in order to view texts with multi character sets using
using ISO 2022 code extention techniques. And I also support some code
conversion among Japanese encoding schemes, JIS X 0208, JIS X 0213,
SJIS, and UJIS.&quot;
