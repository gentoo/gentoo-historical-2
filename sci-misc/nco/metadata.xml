Command-line operators to analyze netCDF files
NetCDF Operator is a suite of programs known as operators. The
operators are stand-alone, command-line programs executable in a POSIX
shell. Operators take one or more netCDF files as input, perform an
operation (e.g., averaging or hyperslabbing), and produce a netCDF
output file. NCO was originally designed to manipulate and analyze
climate data, though it works on any netCDF format datasets.
