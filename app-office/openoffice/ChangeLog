*openoffice-1.0.2-r1 (31 Mar 2003)

  31 Mar 2003; Seth Chandler <sethbc@gentoo.org>; 
  openoffice-1.0.2-r1.ebuild,
  files/1.0.2/openoffice-1.0.2-default-fonts.patch,
  files/1.0.2/openoffice-1.0.2-ft-antialias-advice.patch:
  big openoffice cleanups, introduction of 1.0.2-r1 with better AA text support
  =)

*openoffice-1.0.1-r3 (12 Dec 2002)

  12 Jan 2003; Seth Chandler <sethbc@gentoo.org> openoffice-1.0.1-r3.ebuild
  Fixed several java problems, as well as a generic fix for the libstdc++ 
  stuff.  Should fix most of the open compile error bugs in bugzilla.

  23 Dec 2002; Seth Chandler<sethbc@gentoo.org> openoffice-1.0.1.ebuild-r3 :
  Put in an addpredict to predict writes to /user and /share (same fix
  applied to openoffice-bin ebuild).  I'm looking for a permanent fix to this
  (i.e. not one which uses addpredict) and will update again when its ready =)  

  12 Dec 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> openoffice-1.0.1.ebuild-r3 :
  Fix to work with a gcc-config enabled gcc ...

*openoffice-1.0.1-r2 (02 Dec 2002)

  02 Dec 2002; Seth Chandler <sethbc@gentoo.org> openoffice-1.0.1-r2.ebuild:
  Add -r2 to portage.  I'm requiring jdk 1.4.0 becuase i'm not yet sure if 
  it works with a 1.3 jdk (some fixes applied to make blackdown 1.4 beta build
  may break 1.3.X jdk's).  sun-jdk is still unsupported and will definately
  break the compile.  The wrapper script has been updated to do ld_preload
  for fonts (ooffice-wrapper-1.1) and 2 other patches were added:
  openoffice-1.0.1-use-libstdc++-5.0.1.patch: for people running ~arch and
  openoffice-1.0.1-fix-jdk-1.4.0.patch: which fixes the aformentioned java
  bugs.  Please please please submit any bugs you find to me ASAP ;-)

  02 Dec 2002; Seth Chandler <sethbc@gentoo.org> openoffice-1.0.1-r1.ebuild:
  Fix Az's freetype change so it actually works :-)

  01 Dec 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> openoffice-1.0.1.ebuild-r1 :
  Change it to use freetype-2.1.2.tar.bz2, as I was braindead at the time
  and used the .tar.gz.  Also convert to use epatch().

*openoffice-1.0.1-r1 (22 Sep 2002)

  05 Nov 2002; Mark Guertin <gerk@gentoo.org> openoffice-1.0.1-r1.ebuild :
  added ppc to keywords, set it to require latest glibc (required for ppc) 
  and at least gcc 3.2

  03 Nov 2002; Jon Nall <nall@gentoo.org> openoffice-1.0.1-r1.ebuild :
  added ~ppc to KEYWORDS

  17 Oct 2002; Daniel Ahlberg <aliz@gentoo.org> openoffice-1.0.1-r1.ebuild :
  Added IUSE.

  22 Sep 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> :
  Enable bytecode interpreter, and build against freetype-2.1.2,
  based on great work from Paul de Vrieze <gentoo-bugs@devrieze.net>.
  This should close bug #8096.

  17 Sep 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> :
  Fix openoffice-1.0.1-parallel-build.patch, as stupid
  cvs expanded the keywords in it.

*openoffice-1.0.1 (15 Sep 2002)

  17 Oct 2002; Daniel Ahlberg <aliz@gentoo.org> openoffice-1.0.1.ebuild :
  Added IUSE.

  15 Sep 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> :

  15 Jul 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> :
  General updates to handle changes in our gcc ebuilds;
  Support for gcc-3.1.1.  Also updated the registry .. old
  had version 641 in title, etc.

  06 Aug 2002; Preston A. Elder <prez@gentoo.org> :
  Fixed read_ins.pl to be able make all DONT_DELETE directories
  explicitly, and to put quotes around most references, as some
  contain a directory name with spaces.

*openoffice-1.0.0-r1 (7 Jun 2002)

  7 Jun 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> :

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
  
  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
