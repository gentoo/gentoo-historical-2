  13 Apr 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> abiword-0.99.3-r1.ebuild :

  Jon Nelson (jnelson@gentoo.org) discovered that there is absolutely no
  dependency on freetype fonts (bug #1411).  This is true, as the AbiSuite
  applications tend to install their own fonts into /usr/share/AbiSuite 
  anyway.  Hence, freetype has been removed from the DEPEND list, and
  other intuitive deends like glibc, automake etc have been removed as well.
