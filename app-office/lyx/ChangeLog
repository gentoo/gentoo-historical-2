*lyx-1.2.0 (1 Jun 2002)

  1 Jun 2002; Dan Armak <danarmak@gentoo.org> changelog:
  
  The great new release of lyx (see changelog).
  The lyx=lyx-base+lyx-utils scheme has been abandoned; the app-office/lyx-base
  and app-office/lyx-utils ebuilds have been deprecated. I think they are
  unnecessary. From now on, app-office/lyx will both install lyx itslf and 
  depend on all the lyx utils.

*lyx-1.1.6.4 (1 Feb 2002)

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
  
  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
