  10 Jul 2005; Sven Wegener <swegener@gentoo.org> ical-2.2.1.ebuild:
  QA: Removed 'emake || make || die' and variants. Either a package is
  parallel build safe or it is not. There's nothing like trying and falling
  back.

  24 Apr 2005; Michael Hanselmann <hansmi@gentoo.org> ical-2.2.1.ebuild:
  Stable on ppc.

  05 Oct 2004; Pieter Van den Abeele <pvdabeel@gentoo.org> ical-2.2.1.ebuild:
  Masked ical-2.2.1.ebuild testing for ppc

  18 Jun 2004; Michael Sterrett <mr_bones_@gentoo.org> ical-2.2.1.ebuild:
  IUSE; error check sed; tidy

  06 Jun 2004; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> ical-2.2.1.ebuild:
  Fix compile error reported by Daniel Webert <daniel_webert@web.de> in bug
  #52883, which was caused by the sed statement not actually acting on any
  files. The fix was found by stan <stan@saticed.me.uk>. Additionally, man pages
  were going into /usr/man not /usr/share/man, so fixed that too.

  14 Mar 2004; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> ical-2.2.1.ebuild:
  clean ups for bug #44712 by Michael Sterret <mr_bones_@gentoo.org>

  15 Nov 2003; Brandy Westcott brandy@gentoo.org ical-2.2.1.ebuild:
  Fixed up ebuild to play nice with tcl. Added patch for tcl-8.4. Closes bug
  #22924.

*ical-2.2.1 (31 Jul 2002)
  03 Aug 2002; Chad Huneycutt <chadh@gentoo.org> ical-2.2.1.ebuild: added die
  clause to patch commands to catch errors.

  31 Jul 2002; Chad Huneycutt <chadh@gentoo.org> ical-2.2.1.ebuild: Initial
  import. Most of the patches to get this to compile were taken from the srpm
  for Redhat 7.3
