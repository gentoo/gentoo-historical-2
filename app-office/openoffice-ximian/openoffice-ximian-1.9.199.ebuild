	ewarn " To do this you will have to unmerge openoffice-ximian first. If you "
	ewarn " want to have a backup just for the case that something goes wrong "
	ewarn " during the build process of app-office/openoffice, do: "

	ewarn " # quickpkg openoffice-ximian"

	ewarn " # emerge -k =app-office/openoffice-ximian-1.3.16 "
	ewarn
	ewarn " (Assuming the last version you used was 1.3.16, if not just replace "
