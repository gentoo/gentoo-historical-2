# This ebuild does nothing, it depends on lyx-base and on all known
# packages lyx can make use of. See the lyx-base ebuild for more info.
# Note that these packages ( the ones this ebuild depends on) can be
# installed in any order, both before and after the lyx installation;
# when lyx runs it automatically uses whatever it finds.
