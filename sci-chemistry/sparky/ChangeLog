  Remove myself as maintainer, anyone feel free to work on this, although I'll
  continue to do so as well.

  18 Dec 2005; Donnie Berkholz <dberkholz@gentoo.org>; sparky-3.111.ebuild:
  Prefer RESTRICT=mirror over nomirror, as portage code does.

  We can't mirror this.

*sparky-3.111 (18 Dec 2005)

  +files/fix-install.patch, +metadata.xml, +sparky-3.111.ebuild:
  A new graphical NMR assignment and integration program for proteins, nucleic
  acids, and other polymers. Very strange build system; takes lots of hacking
  and tweaking to get working. Doesn't work with python-2.4, only 2.3.
