*sparky-3.111 (18 Dec 2005)

  18 Dec 2005; Donnie Berkholz <spyderous@gentoo.org>;
  +files/fix-install.patch, +metadata.xml, +sparky-3.111.ebuild:
  A new graphical NMR assignment and integration program for proteins, nucleic
  acids, and other polymers. Very strange build system; takes lots of hacking
  and tweaking to get working. Doesn't work with python-2.4, only 2.3.
