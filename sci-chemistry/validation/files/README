The PDB Validation Suite is a set of applications programs that create
validation reports about 3D structure data.  It is designed to work
with files in mmCIF or PDB format.

This is the same software used in the Validation step of ADIT (AutoDep
Input Tool) at http://pdb.rutgers.edu/adit/.

Note: Binary distribution of this tool contains an additional submodule
"procheck", which does additional structure checking. This submodule is
not part of the source distribution. Therefore the users are advised to
use the binary distribution, if possible.

Refer to README-source or README-binary, depending on the distribution, for
details on installation, build, demos and application usage.
