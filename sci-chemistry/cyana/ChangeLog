*cyana-2.1 (07 Mar 2010)

  07 Mar 2010; Justin Lecher (jlec) <jlec@gentoo.org> +files/2.1-exec.patch,
  +files/2.1-typo.patch, +cyana-2.1.ebuild, +metadata.xml:
  CYANA ((c) by Peter Gu"ntert) is a program for automated structure
  calculation of biological macromolecules on the basis of conformational
  constraints from NMR. The combination of automated NOESY cross peak
  assignment, structure calculation with a fast torsion angle dynamics
  algorithm, and the ease-of-use of CYANA provide for unprecedented
  efficiency in NMR protein structure determination.
