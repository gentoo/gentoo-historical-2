	EZ-Viz was developed as an assistance tool for the difficult to 
	understand user interface of PyMOL. The standard interface is 
	very complex takes a long time to learn, especially for students 
	unfamiliar with the chemistry and busy researchers with little 
	time to learn the commands necessary to use the PyMOL software 
	to its full extent. EZ-Viz allows for users to navigate through 
	PyMOL using a series of clickable buttons and tabs to complete 
	all functions of the PyMol software without ever having to type 
	a single command.
