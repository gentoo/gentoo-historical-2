The MAXIT Program Suite was developed by the PDB (Protein Data Bank) and
NDB (Nucleic Acid Database) to assist in the processing and curation of
macromolecular structure data. The functions of the program suite are
summarized as follows:

(1) Reading and writing PDB and mmCIF format files, and translating between
file formats.

(2) Performing a variety of consistency checks on coordinates, sequence, and
crystal data.

(3) Constructing, transforming, and merging information between formats in
order to minimize the human intervention during file translation and data
processing operations.

(4) Residue numbering in the coordinate section is aligned with the sequence

(5) Atoms in standard and nonstandard residues and atoms in ligands are
reordered and renamed in a standard manner. The residue and ligand description
is held in mmCIF dictionary.

(6) Detection of missing or additional atoms.


Note: Binary distribution of this tool contains an additional submodule
"procheck", which does additional structure checking. This submodule is
not part of the source distribution. Therefore the users are advised to
use the binary distribution, if possible.

Refer to README-source or README-binary, depending on the distribution, for
details on installation, build, demos and application usage.
