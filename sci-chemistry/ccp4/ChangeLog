*ccp4-6.0.1-r1 (07 Aug 2006)

  07 Aug 2006; Donnie Berkholz <dberkholz@gentoo.org>;
  +ccp4-6.0.1-r1.ebuild:
  Add upstream patches. The build system won't accept LDFLAGS, so unset them.
  (#142183) Source the setup script again in src_install() to make sure CBIN
  and CCP4_LIB get set. Not doing this breaks USE=X because the Imakefiles use
  them. Stop changing the value of CCP4_LIB, that was only necessary for the
  bindir=/usr/bin, libdir=/usr/libdir install, which was too much work.

  05 Aug 2006; Donnie Berkholz <dberkholz@gentoo.org>; metadata.xml:
  Remove myself as maintainer, anyone feel free to work on this, although I'll
  continue to do so as well.

  07 Jul 2006; Donnie Berkholz <spyderous@gentoo.org>; metadata.xml:
  Update to my new email address.

  Add CCP4, a popular protein X-ray crystallography toolkit. Relies on portage
  auto-fixing RPATHs for now, because its build system consists of a bunch of
  stuff thrown together into the same tarball.
