# The NMRPipe installation script which we are not allowed to modify
# requires all the following to be present for a complete installation.
# Many of the bundled applications and libraries are afterwards deleted
# (by this ebuild). The Gentoo provided applications and libraries are
# used instead. The notable exception is the Tcl/Tk libraries; NMRPipe
# requires a modified version of these. Unfortunately, this requires to
# redefine the location of the libraries, which is done by sourcing an
# initialisation script. NMRPipe users are used to this, and this ebuild
# also prints a notice to this effect.
