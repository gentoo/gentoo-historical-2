Cultivation is a game about a community of gardeners growing food for themselves
in a shared space.

Cultivation is quite different from most other games. It is a social simulation,
and the primary form of conflict is over land and plant resources---there is no
shooting, but there are plenty of angry looks. It is also an evolution
simulation. Within the world of Cultivation, you can explore a virtually
infinite spectrum of different plant and gardener varieties.

All of the graphics, sounds, melodies,and other content in Cultivation are 100%
procedurally generated at playtime. In other words, there are no hand-painted
texture maps---instead, each object has a uniquely "grown" appearance. Every
time you play, Cultivation generates fresh visuals, music, and behaviors.
