*tmda-0.45 ( 5 Feb 2002 )

  5 Feb 2002; Karl Trygve Kalleberg <karltk@gentoo.org> tmda-0.45.ebuild, files/digest-tmda-0.45 :
  
  TMDA (Tagged Message Delivery Agent) is an OSI certified software 
  application designed to significantly reduce the amount of SPAM/UCE
  (junk-mail) you receive.  TMDA combines a "whitelist" (for known/trusted 
  senders), a "blacklist" (for undesired senders), and a cryptographically 
  enhanced confirmation system (for unknown, but legitimate senders).  TMDA 
  strives to be more effectual, yet less time-consuming than traditional 
  filters.
