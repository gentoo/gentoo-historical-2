  Changed the USE flags from mta-ldap, mta-tls, and mta-mysql to ldap, ssl, and
  mysql respectively.  Also, changed the checks to the official use foo &&

  during the emerge process.

*postfix-1.1.3-r2 (20 Feb 2002)

  20 Feb 2002; Donny Davies <woodchip@gentoo.org> postfix-1.1.3-r2.ebuild :

  This update fixes the permissions and ownership on /usr/sbin/postdrop and
  /usr/sbin/postqueue, which were not set correctly last time.  Moved the
  postdrop group detection/creation into pkg_setup() to facilitate this.
  *Really* fix the CCARGS and AUXLIBS getting nuked this time.  Hooray!

*postfix-1.1.3-r1 (18 Feb 2002)

  18 Feb 2002; Donny Davies <woodchip@gentoo.org> ChangeLog, postfix-1.1.3-r1.ebuild,
  files/postfix.rc6 files/smtp.pam files/smtpd.conf:

  Lots of changes, ok here we go:  First, we now compile with cyrus-sasl library
  support, which gives us smtp authentication.  Next, there is support for the mta-tls
  USE variable which gives you secure connection support.  There are sample files in
  the files directory for smtp authentication.  This version fixes a glitch with the
  maildrop directory (we now let postfix create it itself, which it will do when you
  run 'postfix check' for the first time after installing this.  We create the postdrop
  group now, in pkg_postinst() if its not already on the user's system.  Some small
  cosmetic changes in the initscript, changing spaces for tabs.  The /var/spool/postfix
  directory is dropped into the system permanently now, which is good.  Fixed a small
  bug with CCARGS getting nuked.  Special thanks goto Ingo Luetkebohle
  <gentoo@blank.pages.de> for an *excellent* bug report.  Thanks Ingo!

  NB: I have successfully tested *outbound* authentication, and leave inbound
  authentication to those using it.  If you find bugs, please report them.  Enjoy.

*postfix-1.1.3 (3 Feb 2002)

*postfix-1.1.2-r1 (1 Feb 2002)

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
  
  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
