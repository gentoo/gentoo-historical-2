  27 Jun 2002; Phil Bordelon <sunflare@gentoo.org> mailbase-0.00-r4.ebuild :

  unmerged from an upgrade.  Also cleaned up the ebuild to match the current
  format.  The original Author of the script was Jerry Alexandratos <jerry@gentoo.org>.

  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
