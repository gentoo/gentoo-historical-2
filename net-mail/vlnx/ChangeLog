*vlnx-414e-r1 (1 Feb 2002)
  18 Mar 2002; Chad Huneycutt <chadh@gentoo.org>
  uvscan was complaining of missing library, which indeed was not being
  installed.  I updated the ebuild to install the library and also a man page.
  Unfortunately, uvscan still will not run, complaining that the program has
  been tampered with
