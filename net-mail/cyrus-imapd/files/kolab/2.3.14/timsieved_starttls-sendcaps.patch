This patch was downloaded from https://bugzilla.andrew.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/src/cyrus/timsieved/parser.c.diff?r1=1.44;r2=1.45
(minus the CVS keywords)

It should be reverse-applied with patch -p2 -R to work around the kontact
behaviour described in kolab/issue2443 (kontact aborts sieve when imapd sends
capabilities after starttls) and can be dropped as soon as kontact has a way
to work with old and new cyrus imapd servers.
