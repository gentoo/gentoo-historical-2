*balsa-2.0.0_pre1 (30May 2002)
  30 May 2002; Spider <spider@gentoo.org> balsa-2.0.0_pre1.ebuild :
  Adding the Gnome2 branch
  updated the patch to apply
  please note that this is a "technical preview" thats why I added the
  _pre1 and the date tag inside the ebuild, when balsa updates the
  package we can modify the date and upp the pre until the final version
  is released.

  Btw.. do balsa -ever- release a "stable" product? I sense debianism
  here.
