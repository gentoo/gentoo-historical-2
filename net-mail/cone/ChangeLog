*cone-0.56 (14 Dec 2003)

  14 Dec 2003; Brian Jackson <iggy@gentoo.org> cone-0.56.ebuild:
  new package, cone is a console based news/mail reader written by the author of
  courier. This has been living in my overlay for awhile, and I've had a few
  other people test it. Let me know if you give this a try and it works or
  doesn't.
