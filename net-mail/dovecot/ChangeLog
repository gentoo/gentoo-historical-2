*dovecot-0.99.10.5 (30 May 2004)

  30 May 2004; Grant Goodyear <g2boojum@gentoo.org> +dovecot-0.99.10.5.ebuild:
  Version bump (thanks to David Pufer, bug # 52371).  I also did some
  fairly massive cleaning, so this ebuild could be massively broken
  (although it does seem to be working just fine for me -- dovecot is the imap
  server that my family uses).  Also replaced the "maildir" USE flag with 
  "mbox", since maildir is the Gentoo default and thus should never have
  been a USE flag, and cleaned up the logic to make gnutls preferred over
  ssl if both gnutls and ssl are secified in USE.

  09 May 2004; Jason Wever <weeve@gentoo.org> dovecot-0.99.10.4.ebuild:
  Added ~sparc keyword.

  07 May 2004; Danny van Dyk <kugelfang@gentoo.org> dovecot-0.99.10.4.ebuild:
  Marked ~amd64.

*dovecot-0.99.10.4 (10 Apr 2004)

  10 Apr 2004; Grant Goodyear <g2boojum@hotmail.com> :
  Long overdue new package.  Thanks to Zach Bagnell, Andreas Simon, Lars 
  Trieloff, Andrew Cooks, Tony Vroon, and tseng.
