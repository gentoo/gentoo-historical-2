*amavis-0.3.12_pre8 (23 Oct 2002)

  15 Nov 2002; Nick Hadaway <raker@gentoo.org> amavis-0.3.12_pre8.ebuild :
  The ebuild should now detect what mail system you are using.
  postfix, exim, qmail, and sendmail are detected.

  23 Oct 2002; Nick Hadaway <raker@gentoo.org> amavis-0.3.12_pre8.ebuild,
  files/digest-amavis-0.3.12_pre8 :
  Version bump.  0.2.x of amavis is non-maintained code.  The ebuild currently
  only supports postfix as the mta.  Depending on how flexible the configuration
  is I may end up splitting this ebuild into amavis-postfix, amavis-exim, etc...
