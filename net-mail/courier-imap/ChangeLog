*courier-imap-1.4.1-r2 (21 Feb 2002)

21 Feb 2002; Grant Goodyear <g2boojum@gentoo.org> :
	Modified the ebuild so that /usr/sbin/{imapd,pop3d} get renamed to
	/usr/sbin/{courier-imapd,courier-pop3d}.  I also had to change hack
	the /usr/lib/courier-imap/*.rc files to call these newly-named functions.
	While I was at it I cleaned up the ebuilds and fixed the not-yet-caught
	bug that pop3d was still trying to use Maildir instead of ${MAILDIR}.
	Fixes bug #584.

*courier-imap-1.4.1-r1 (1 Feb 2002)

  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
