*courier-imap-1.4.3 (1 Apr 2002)

  1 Apr 2002; Donny Davies <woodchip@gentoo.org> :

  Updated to latest release.  Made some cosmetic/beautification fixes.
  It's real purdy now :)  Added --enable-workarounds-for-imap-client-bugs
  to the ./configure flags, which helps some clients -- notable Netscape
  Messenger.  Commented out the pam.d/ stuff since it already comes with
  pam_stack aware pam config files.  Gentoo now has pam_stack.. Hooray!

*courier-imap-1.4.1-r4 (14 Mar 2002)

  14 Mar 2002; Grant Goodyear <g2boojum@gentoo.org> :

  Fixed bug where /etc/courier-imap/pop3d didn't have MAILDIR=.maildir set.

*courier-imap-1.4.1-r2 (21 Feb 2002)

21 Feb 2002; Grant Goodyear <g2boojum@gentoo.org> :

  Modified the ebuild so that /usr/sbin/{imapd,pop3d} get renamed to
  /usr/sbin/{courier-imapd,courier-pop3d}.  I also had to change hack
  the /usr/lib/courier-imap/*.rc files to call these newly-named functions.
  While I was at it I cleaned up the ebuilds and fixed the not-yet-caught
  bug that pop3d was still trying to use Maildir instead of ${MAILDIR}.
  Fixes bug #584.

*courier-imap-1.4.1-r1 (1 Feb 2002)

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
  
  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
