*pine-4.44-r4 (15 Apr 2002)

  15 Apr 2002; Jared H. Hudson <jhhudso@gentoo.org> :

  Changed the ebuild so that it no longer PROVIDEs virtual/imapUW or
  the imap headers. These imap headers and static library will be provided
  by net-mail/uw-imap exclusively now.
	
*pine-4.44-r1 (21 Feb 2002)

  21 Feb 2002; Grant Goodyear <g2boojum@gentoo.org> :

  Revamped our ebuild to use RH patches so that I could
  include SSL and LDAP support (both controlled by use variables).  I don't
  know enough about pine to test it properly.

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
  
  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
