# DESCRIPTION OF THE RULES TO REMIND ME OF HOW THIS FILE WORKS
#
# If you set 'allow', this means that our mail server will allow
# the specified IP range to make a TCP connection to our server
#
# If you set 'deny', this means that our mail server will not allow
# the specified IP range to make a TCP connection to our server
#
# If you set RELAYCLIENT="", this means that the listed IP range is 
# allowed to relay mail through our server
#
# If you dont set RELAYCLIENT="", this means that the listed IP range
# will not be able to relay mail through our server
#
# If you set RBLSMTPD="", this means that the listed IP ranges will
# not be checked against any of the RBL databases
#
# If you set RBLSMTPD="some text here", this means that an RBL lookup
# wont be performed, but the mail will be rejected with the specified
# text as a 4xx temp error message
#
# If you set RBLSMTPD="-some text here", this means that an RBL lookup
# wont be performed, but the mail will be rejected with the specified
# text as a 5xx perm error message
#
# If you do not set RBLSMTPD="" or ="some text", then an RBL lookup
# will be performed. If the lookup is successful, then RBLSMTPD will
# return your custom error message (as specified in the -r parameter
# in smtpd supervise script)
#
#-----------------------------------------------------
# HERE ARE THE RULES! :
#-----------------------------------------------------
# BYPASS OPEN RELAY CHECKING FOR THESE IPS :
#
# These IPs are ones that we have setup so that they arent RBL checked.
# We have done this because these particular servers are RBL listed,
# and for whatever reason they can't/won't fix their open relay problem,
# and we still want to be able to receive mail from them.

# reminder text goes here for this entry so we know the story...
#222.222.222.222:allow,RBLSMTPD=""
#
#-----------------------------------------------------------------
# DONT ALLOW THESE IPS TO SEND MAIL TO US :
#
# mailXX.offermail.net connecting regularly and sending invalid
# format messages causing exit with status 256 (bare linefeed normally)
# entry added 15/12/2001
# after looking at the mail coming from these servers it was found to be spam
#216.242.75.100-116:allow,RBLSMTPD="-Connections from this IP have been banned."
#
# heaps of spam from replyto of *@freeamateurhotties.com dec2001
#64.228.127.:allow,RBLSMTPD="-Connections refused due to spam from freeamateurhotties.com"
#154.20.94.:allow,RBLSMTPD="-Connections refused due to spam from freeamateurhotties.com"
#209.151.132.:allow,RBLSMTPD="-Connections refused due to spam from freeamateurhotties.com"
#216.18.85.:allow,RBLSMTPD="-Connections refused due to spam from freeamateurhotties.com"
#
#-----------------------------------------------------------------
# ALLOW THESE IPS TO RELAY MAIL THROUGH OUR SERVER
#
# Local class-c's from our LAN are allowed to relay,
# and we wont bother doing any RBL checking.
#123.123.123.:allow,RELAYCLIENT="",RBLSMTPD=""
#123.111.111.:allow,RELAYCLIENT="",RBLSMTPD=""
#
# Connections from localhost are allowed to relay 
# (because the WebMail server runs on localhost),
# and obviously there is no point trying to perform an RBL check.
127.0.0.1:allow,RELAYCLIENT="",RBLSMTPD=""
#
#-----------------------------------------------------------------
# ALLOW EVERYONE ELSE TO SEND US MAIL
#
# Everyone else can make connections to our server,
# but not allowed to relay
# RBL lookups are performed
:allow
