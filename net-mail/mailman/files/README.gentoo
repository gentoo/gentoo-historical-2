Follow these instructions to finish setting up mailman. This file and the
original ebuild were tweaked by me <lamer@gentoo.org> but were graciously
submitted by Joby Walker (YOU RULE!) 
2003 Jul 09: updated by Jesus Perez and re-tweaked by me <raker@gentoo.org>
for 2.1.x.

Please view the documentation on Mailman at: http://www.list.org/

I have configured Mailman to install in /usr/local/mailman by default, to change
this you will need to modify the INSTALLDIR variable in the ebuild and the
locations in the mailman.conf file.

1) If this is your first time installing mailman, after your "emerge mailman",
**and you are using apache 1.x**, you will need to run:

ebuild /var/db/pkg/net-mail/mailman-$VERSION/mailman-$VERSION.ebuild config

This will add an Include in your apache.conf to mailman.conf

2) In your /etc/conf.d/apache (for apache 1.x)
	or /etc/conf.d/apache2 (for apache 2.x) 
	file add the additional option:

	-D MAILMAN

3) Make sure mailman is a part of the cron group

4) This must be done as user mailman:

	su - mailman

Add the cron jobs:

	cd cron
	crontab crontab.in
	cd ..

Create the site password:

	bin/mmsitepass

and main list:

	bin/newlist mailman


5) Change back to root:

	exit

Add this to /etc/mail/aliases (and see point 9 for notes):
     mailman:              "|/usr/local/mailman/mail/mailman post mailman"
     mailman-admin:        "|/usr/local/mailman/mail/mailman admin mailman"
     mailman-bounces:      "|/usr/local/mailman/mail/mailman bounces mailman"
     mailman-confirm:      "|/usr/local/mailman/mail/mailman confirm mailman"
     mailman-join:         "|/usr/local/mailman/mail/mailman join mailman"
     mailman-leave:        "|/usr/local/mailman/mail/mailman leave mailman"
     mailman-owner:        "|/usr/local/mailman/mail/mailman owner mailman"
     mailman-request:      "|/usr/local/mailman/mail/mailman request mailman"
     mailman-subscribe:    "|/usr/local/mailman/mail/mailman subscribe mailman"
     mailman-unsubscribe:  "|/usr/local/mailman/mail/mailman unsubscribe mailman"
  
Run newaliases (only if you use sendmail).

	newaliases
    
Copy the web icons:
     cp /usr/local/mailman/icons/* /var/www/localhost/icons

6) Start the mailman daemon:

	/etc/init.d/mailman start

and add it to default runlevel (optional but recommended):

	rc-update add mailman default

7) For each list created (either with web interface or with bin/newlist) 
this must be added to /etc/mail/aliases (see smrsh notes below)
replace <list-name> with the name of the list:

	<list-name>: "|/usr/local/mailman/mail/mailman post <list-name>"
	<list-name>-admin: "|/usr/local/mailman/mail/mailman admin <list-name>"
	<list-name>-bounces: "|/usr/local/mailman/mail/mailman bounces <list-name>"
     	<list-name>-confirm: "|/usr/local/mailman/mail/mailman confirm <list-name>"
     	<list-name>-join: "|/usr/local/mailman/mail/mailman join <list-name>"
	<list-name>-leave: "|/usr/local/mailman/mail/mailman leave <list-name>"
	<list-name>-owner: "|/usr/local/mailman/mail/mailman owner <list-name>"
	<list-name>-request: "|/usr/local/mailman/mail/mailman request <list-name>"
     	<list-name>-subscribe: "|/usr/local/mailman/mail/mailman subscribe <list-name>"
	<list-name>-unsubscribe: "|/usr/local/mailman/mail/mailman unsubscribe <list-name>"

Run newaliases:

	newaliases

smrsh notes
-----------
(if you use sendmail, you are surely using srmsh) you must note that 
sendmail won't run any program outside of EBINDIR. I tried to change 
EBINDIR using,define(`confEBINDIR', `/usr/local/mailman/mail')dnl in 
sendmail.mc but it didn't work, so mailman must be placed in EBINDIR, 
which in Gentoo is /usr/adm/sm.bin, so you must run as root:

     ln -s /usr/local/mailman/mail/mailman /usr/adm/sm.bin/mailman

And the lines in /etc/mail/aliases which refer to 
/usr/local/mailman/mail/mailman must be changed to mailman:

     <list-name>:              "|mailman post <list-name>"
     <list-name>-admin:        "|mailman admin <list-name>"
     <list-name>-bounces:      "|mailman bounces <list-name>"
     <list-name>-confirm:      "|mailman confirm <list-name>"
     <list-name>-join:         "|mailman join <list-name>"
     <list-name>-leave:        "|mailman leave <list-name>"
     <list-name>-owner:        "|mailman owner <list-name>"
     <list-name>-request:      "|mailman request <list-name>"
     <list-name>-subscribe:    "|mailman subscribe <list-name>"
     <list-name>-unsubscribe:  "|mailman unsubscribe <list-name>"


Other Helpful things to know...
-------------------------------
run "bin/check_perms -f" from the root mailman directory
(/usr/local/mailman) to check and fix permission problems.
