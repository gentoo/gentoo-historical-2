Follow these instructions to finish setting up mailman. This file and the
original ebuild were tweaked by me <lamer@gentoo.org> but were graciously
submitted by Joby Walker (YOU RULE!)

Please view the documentation on Mailman at: http://www.list.org/

I have configured Mailman to install in /var/mailman by default, to change
this you will need to modify the INSTALLDIR variable in the ebuild and the
locations in the mailman.conf(.apache) file.

1) If this is your first time installing mailman, after your "emerge mailman", you will need to
run:

ebuild /var/db/pkg/net-mail/mailman-x.x.x/mailman-x.x.x.ebuild config

This will add an Include in your apache.conf to mailman.conf

2) And then in you /etc/conf.d/apache file add the additional option:

-D MAILMAN

3) Make sure mailman is a part of the cron group

4) The rest must be done as user mailman so:

su - mailman

5) Add the cron jobs:

cd cron
crontab crontab.in
cd ..

6) create the site password:

bin/mmsitepass

From here you just need to add lists as per the documentation. I placed the
INSTALL file in /usr/share/doc/mailman-$VERSION/ 

Remember:

Do everything as user "mailman".  If root you will cause mailman to fail,
but it is correctable by running "bin/check_perms -f" from the root
mailman directory (/var/mailman).

NOTE TO ORIGINAL AUTHOR: Once again thanks for the submission, you rule!
