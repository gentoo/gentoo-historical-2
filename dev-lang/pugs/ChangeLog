  14 Mar 2005; Michael Cummings <mcummings@gentoo.org> +metadata.xml,
  +pugs-6.0.11.ebuild:
  Introducing pugs, an implementation of the not yet released perl6 language
  using haskell. Ebuild worked on tirelessly by Adrian Lambeck
  <adrian@basicsedv.de> in bug 8335. This is being added to dev-lang since
  currently it is a seperate entity from dev-lang/perl.
