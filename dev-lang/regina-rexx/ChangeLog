  Initial release

  Regina is a Rexx interpreter that has been ported to most Unix platforms (Linux,
  FreeBSD, Solaris, AIX, HP-UX, etc.) and also to OS/2, eCS, DOS,
  Win9x/Me/NT/2k/XP, Amiga, QNX, BeOS, MacOS X, EPOC32, AtheOS, OpenVMS and
  OpenEdition. Rexx is a programming language that was designed to be easy to use
  for inexperienced programmers yet powerful enough for experienced users. It is
  also a language ideally suited as a macro language for other applications.
