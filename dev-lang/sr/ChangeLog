*sr-2.3.2 (01 Nov 2002)

  08 Nov 2002; George Shapovalov <george@gentoo.org> sr-2.3.2.ebuild :

  first inclusion
  "SR (Synchronizing Resources) is a language for writing concurrent programs. The
  main language constructs are resources and operations. Resources encapsulate
  processes and variables they share; operations provide the primary mechanism for
  process interaction. SR provides a novel integration of the mechanisms for
  invoking and servicing operations. Consequently, all of local and remote
  procedure call, rendezvous, message passing, dynamic process creation,
  multicast, and semaphores are supported. SR also supports shared global
  variables and operations."
