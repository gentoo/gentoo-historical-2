designed and implemented at the Systems Research Center of Digital Equipment 
Corporation, and later extended and improved by a large number of individuals and 
organizations. In recent years, the most complete and actively worked-on 
distribution of Modula-3 was maintained at the Ecole Polytechnique de Montréal by 
Michel Dagenais. In March 2002 Michel Dagenais has announced that the WWW and CVS 
services for PM3 will be terminated in August 2002. Till that time, releases of 
and information concerning PM3 can still be found at m3.polymtl.ca/m3/. The PM3 
CVS repository has already been moved to www.elegosoft.com.
