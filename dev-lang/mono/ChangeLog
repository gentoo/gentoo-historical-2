*mono-0.12 (24 Jul 2002)

  23 Jul 2002; Phil Bordelon <sunflare@gentoo.org> ChangeLog: Unmasking the ebuild.
  PLEASE NOTE that the build has been known to bomb on at least one machine, although
  it worked on all of the rest of them that we tested it on.  This is very much
  work-in-progress software, so please take that into account before you start to
  post bugs.

  23 Jul 2002; Phil Bordelon <sunflare@gentoo.org> mono-0.12.ebuild: dodoc should
  grab 'ChangeLog,' not 'Changelog.'  Fixed.

  23 Jul 2002; Phil Bordelon <sunflare@gentoo.org> mono-0.12.ebuild, ChangeLog:
  Original release.  The ebuild was submitted by Luis Mayoral <satriani@okulto.net>.
  Lintool'd and repoman'd by me.
