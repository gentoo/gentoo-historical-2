  30 Mar 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> : changed PROVIDE from
  virtual/python-2.2 to virtual/python.  No rev bump.

*python-2.2-r5 (17 Mar 2002)

  17 Mar 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> : new release with a
  /usr/lib/python/site-packages directory; /usr/lib/python2.2/site-packages is
  a symlink pointing to this new directory.  This allows new versions of python
  (2.3, etc) to also point to the generic site-packages directory, allowing
  already-installed python modules to be available to all installed versions of
  python.

*python-2.2-r4 (1 Feb 2002)

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
  
  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
