  Added include flag for compilation of tcltk with python to compile
  correctly.

  --------
	
  06 Apr 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> : the 2.2-r4 ebuild now
  disables C++ support if we are creating a new build image (since we have no
  C++ in that case).
  
  30 Mar 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> : changed PROVIDE from
  virtual/python-2.2 to virtual/python.  No rev bump.

*python-2.2-r4 (1 Feb 2002)

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
  
  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
