*icc-5.0.1 (12 Apr 2002)

  12 Apr 2002; William McArthur <Leknor@Leknor.com> ChangeLog :

  Initial Gentoo package. The install from Intel is RPM based so I extract
  the i386 RPMs manually using rpm2cpio and cpio. (Idea taken from the
  realplayer ebuild) Other than running rpm for you the install script just
  replaces some stings in a few files with sed, so I copied and mangled the
  relavent lines from their install and use them. I also correct a typo
  descriped on Intel's web site. This fix should be removed at next icc upgrade.
  The install is a simple copy and adding one file to /etc/env.d to set up a few
  enviroment settings icc needs. After the package is merged I inform the user
  where to get a license key and where to put it.
