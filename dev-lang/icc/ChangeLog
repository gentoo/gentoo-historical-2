  18 Sep 2003; Jon Portnoy <avenj@gentoo.org> icc-7.1.006.ebuild,
  icc-7.1.029.ebuild :
  _Much_ faster unpacking thanks to rpm.eclass and Georgi Georgiev.
  See bug 23179 for more information.

*icc-7.1.029 (18 Sep 2003)

  18 Sep 2003; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> icc-7.1.029.ebuild:
  new version marked stable for ia64, unstable for x86. ia64 support
  integrated into this ebuild. Also switched to slower rpm2targz simply
  because it doesn't require "rpm" to be merged.

*icc-7.1.006 (11 April 2003)

  11 April 2003; Jon Portnoy <avenj@gentoo.org> icc-7.1.006.ebuild :

  Version bump.

  25 May 2003; Jon Portnoy <avenj@gentoo.org> icc-7.1.006.ebuild :

  Added icpc wrapper.

*icc-7.0.065-r2 (20 Dec 2002)

  20 Dec 2002; Jon Portnoy <avenj@gentoo.org> icc-7.0.065-r2.ebuild :

  Fixed 05icc-ifc to include INTEL_LICENSE_FILE. Bug found by Zadeh
  (garen@garen.net).

*icc-7.0.065-r1 (11 Dec 2002)

  11 Dec 2002; Jon Portnoy <avenj@gentoo.org> icc-7.0.065-r1.ebuild :

  Changed the "icc" wrapper script to properly translate gcc CFLAGS into
  icc CFLAGS.

*icc-7.0.065 (10 Dec 2002)

  10 Dec 2002; Jon Portnoy <avenj@gentoo.org> icc-7.0.065.ebuild :

  Changed the naming to more accurately reflect the current ICC
  version number. Also fixed the primary executable and added a warning
  about compiling important applications with icc.

  8 Dec 2002 Jon Portnoy <avenj@gentoo.org> icc-7.0.ebuild :

  Added a warning about the behavior of the main executable.
  'icc' will return errors; 'iccbin' works fine.
 
  Fixed the warning messages to fit a standard terminal.

  Fixed the old version checking statement to avoid matching
  the current version.

  5 Dec 2002  William McArthur <sandymac@gentoo.org> icc-7.0.ebuild :

  Included some improvments from Jon Portnoy from http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=11211

*icc-7.0
  25 Nov 2002  William McArthur <sandymac@gentoo.org> icc-7.0.ebuild :

  Basicly just updated the icc-6.0-r1 with new urls and changed the message at the end.

*icc-6.0-r1 (13 May 2002)

  13 May 2002  William McArthur <sandymac@gentoo.org> icc-6.0-r1.ebuild :

  Fixed a problem where I missed a place a file needs to be sed'ed during the
  install. Change 05icc to 05icc-ifc because both the icc-6 and ifc-6 packages
  used the same env info and I didn't want duplicate data.

*icc-6.0 (24 Apr 2002)

  24 Apr 2002  William McArthur <sandymac@gentoo.org> icc-6.0.ebuild :

  The icc-6.0.ebuild is functionally identical to the icc-5.0.1.ebuild . A few
  tweaks were made for the minor differeces in Intel's package.

*icc-5.0.1 (12 Apr 2002)

  12 Apr 2002; William McArthur <sandymac@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :

  Initial Gentoo package. The install from Intel is RPM based so I extract
  the i386 RPMs manually using rpm2cpio and cpio. (Idea taken from the
  realplayer ebuild) Other than running rpm for you the install script just
  replaces some stings in a few files with sed, so I copied and mangled the
  relavent lines from their install and use them. I also correct a typo
  descriped on Intel's web site. This fix should be removed at next icc upgrade.
  The install is a simple copy and adding one file to /etc/env.d to set up a few
  enviroment settings icc needs. After the package is merged I inform the user
  where to get a license key and where to put it.
