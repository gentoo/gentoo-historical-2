Eleven is a programming language for creating robust, scalable Web
applications quickly and easily. It offers a 20x programmer
productivity increase over traditional server programming languages
like ASP, PHP, and JSP by automating state management and taking
control of the application's look and feel. From high-level source
code with a simple, C-like syntax, the compiler generates complete,
ready-to-run implementations in PHP or mod_perl. Applications maintain
their state in a relational database and are inherently
fault-tolerant, secure, and scalable.
