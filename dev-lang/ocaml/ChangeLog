*ocaml-3.04-r2 (01 Aug 2002)

  02 Aug 2002; George Shapovalov <george@gentoo.org> ocaml-3.04-r2.ebuild :

  tk dependence is reported (by Tim Hobbs <rectrix@rectrix.cx>) to be optional,
  made it depend on tcltk use flag.
  Created and masked new revision to give this some testing without interuption 
  to the working package.
  Core devs (cvs access people): please do not unmask it on server! Instead please 
  let me know that it tested Ok. I will do necessary modifications to the -r1 
  and delete -r2. This way we will not force everybody to rebuild perfectly 
  working package.
