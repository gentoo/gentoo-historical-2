*smarteiffel-1.00beta5 (16 Nov 2002)

  22 Nov 2002; George Shapovalov <george@gentoo.org> smarteiffel-1.0_beta5.ebuild, files/digest-smarteiffel-1.0_beta5 :
  cleaned up and committed to portage.

  22 Nov 2002; Steven Wong <wongs15@tartarus.uwa.edu.au> :
  - Fixed empty loadpath.UNIX being generated.
  - lib/ and tools/ directories are installed now.
  - Fixed links in html documentation; they don't reference to "../man"
    anymore.

  16 Nov 2002; Steven Wong <wongs15@tartarus.uwa.edu.au> :
  Ebuild submitted by me. There is still some murky places
  standard-wise, but I think it's better to leave this mostly for the
  SmartEiffel developers to clean out. Big thanks to George Shapovalov
  <george@gentoo.org> who did all the researching to find how other
  distributions packaged this strange beast. :)
