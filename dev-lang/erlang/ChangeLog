*erlang-9c (09 May 2003)

  19 Jun 2003; Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org> :
  Cleaned up and made the ebuild more 'portage' like ... changed sed cmds to dosed

  09 May 2003; George Shapovalov <george@gentoo.org> erlang-9c.ebuild :
  new version (#20625), original versio n is R9B-1, 9c seems to be the only approximation

  Thanks to Claes Wikstrom <klacke@hyber.org> for an update.
