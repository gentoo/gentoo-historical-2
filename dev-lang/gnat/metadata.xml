<longdescription>GNAT, the (GN)U (A)da (T)oolchain, is a high performance Ada 95 development environment based on the mature GCC compiler technology. It implements the full Ada 95 language defined by the ISO standard and is upward compatible with Ada 83. It includes the only Ada 95 compiler technology to be 100% validated on a large number of hardware/operating system platforms (core language as well as all Specialized Needs Annexes). GCC's extensive portability makes GNAT ideal for use as a cross-compiler for embedded development. Furthermore, because of the common code-generator technology of GCC, GNAT has excellent support for multi-language programming.</longdescription>
