  29 Sep 2003; David Holm <dholm@gentoo.org> gnat-3.15p-r3.ebuild:
  Fixed a minor build problem on x86.

*gnat-3.15p-r3 (28 Sep 2003)

  28 Sep 2003; David Holm <dholm@gentoo.org>
  gnat-3.15p-r3.ebuild, files/gnat-3.15p-gentoo.patch.bz2,
  files/gnat-3.15p-noaddr2line.patch.bz2:
  Added gnat-3.15p-r3 which has now passed 26/26 of ACATS tests on x86 and 24/26
  on ppc (because ppc does not provide a threading system yet).

  20 Sep 2003; David Holm <dholm@gentoo.org> gnat-3.15p-r2.ebuild:
  Placed the powerpc bootstrap compiler on dev.gentoo.org while rsync is being
  fixed (suggested by seemant).

  18 Sep 2003; David Holm <dholm@gentoo.org> gnat-3.15p-r2.ebuild:
  I forgot to set the CFLAGS before running configure which would cause a
  failure with unstripped flags in make.conf.

  18 Sep 2003; David Holm <dholm@gentoo.org> gnat-3.15p-r2.ebuild,
  files/gnat-3.15p-gentoo-nonx86.patch.bz2:
  After a lot of hard work I finally managed to compile a bootstrap compiler for
  ppc. Currently the ppc version uses a simpler thread model than the x86
  version, I will look into this at a later time.

  14 Sep 2003; David Holm <dholm@gentoo.org> gnat-3.15p-r2.ebuild:
  Do not attempt any kind of optimizations. This will hopefully clear bug #27683.

*gnat-5.0_pre20030822 (27 Aug 2003)

  27 Aug 2003; David Holm <dholm@gentoo.org> gnat-5.0_pre20030822.ebuild:
  Added a gnat 5.0 CVS snapshot. It is masked in package.mask because it is
  unstable, but some people might want it for updating their code or simply to
  test the new gcc 3-based backend.

  17 Aug 2003; David Holm <dholm@gentoo.org> metadata.xml:
  Added metadata.xml

*gnat-3.15p-r2 (13 Aug 2003)

  13 Aug 2003; George Shapovalov <george@gentoo.org> gnat-3.15p-r2.ebuild, files/gnat-3.15p-gentoo.patch.bz2 :
  new revision (#26542) by dholm, fixes #26461 + libs were moved under /usr/lib/ada to 
  avoid any possible interaction with gcc

*gnat-3.15p-r1 (24 Jul 2003)

  24 Jul 2003; George Shapovalov <george@gentoo.org> gnat-3.15p-r1.ebuild :
  new revision (by David Holm <dholm@delia.com>) - installs docs + few minor cleanups
  also static libraries are now installed as well.

*gnat-3.14p
*gnat-3.15p (17 Jun 2003)

  17 Jun 2003; George Shapovalov <george@gentoo.org> gnat-3.14p.ebuild, gnat-3.14p.ebuild, Manifest, files/digest-gnat-3.1{4,5}p :
  initial release (#13113)
  GNAT Ada Compiler
  thanks to Per Dalgas Jakobsen <gentoo@knaldgas.dk> for initial submission 
  and David Holm <dholm@delia.com> for improved versions and support
