  From the home page:

  The Glasgow Haskell Compiler is a robust, fully-featured, optimising compiler 
  and interactive environment for Haskell 98, GHC compiles Haskell to either 
  native code or C.  It implements numerous experimental language extensions 
  to Haskell 98; for example: concurrency, a foreign language interface, 
  multi-parameter type classes, scoped type variables, existential and universal 
  quantification, unboxed types, exceptions, weak pointers, and so on.  GHC comes 
  with a generational garbage collector, and a space and time profiler.
