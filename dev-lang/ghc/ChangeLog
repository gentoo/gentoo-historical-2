*ghc-5.02.3.ebuild (09 Jun 2002)

  18 Jun 2002; George Shapovalov <george@gentoo.org> ghc-5.02.3.ebuild :

  Few improvements by Sven Moritz Hallberg :
  Build DocBook documentation only if USEing 'doc'. Require DocBook DTD 3.1 in
  that case.

  Thanks to a bug report by Matthew Walton I've noticed that GHC requires the
  DocBook DTD 3.1, not 4.1.

  First submission
  From the home page:

  The Glasgow Haskell Compiler is a robust, fully-featured, optimising compiler 
  and interactive environment for Haskell 98, GHC compiles Haskell to either 
  native code or C.  It implements numerous experimental language extensions 
  to Haskell 98; for example: concurrency, a foreign language interface, 
  multi-parameter type classes, scoped type variables, existential and universal 
  quantification, unboxed types, exceptions, weak pointers, and so on.  GHC comes 
  with a generational garbage collector, and a space and time profiler.
