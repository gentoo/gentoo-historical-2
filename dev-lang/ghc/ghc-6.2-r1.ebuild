#Some explanation of bootstrap logic:
#
#After thinking through the best way to bootstrap ghc I decided to split it into
#ghc and ghc-bin and make ghc depend on ghc-bin.
#  The ebuild has been revamped and greatly simplified. Bootstrap off old 4x hc files no longer works on x86.
#Not sure what happens with old scheme on sparc, as I did not see any test reports.
#
#The considerations:
#Making ghc unpack binary build first (under ${WORKDIR}) and bootstrapping from that will effectively force
#ghc-bin reinstall every time ghc is rebuilt or upgraded. What is worse it will likely force download of binary image
#at upgrade, which is not nice (in fact quite bad for modem users - 16+ MB).
#
#The best results are achieved if ghc-bin is left alone after ghc installation -
#Both ebuilds install in the same place, thus space penalty is minimal. In fact only the docs exist in double
#(considering that ghc is not installing much docs at present this looks more like an advantage).
#When the upgrade time comes, if you still have ghc-bin around, portage will happily bootstrap off
#your existing ghc (or ghc-bin, whichever was merged last), without attempting to ruin anything...
#
#There is only one issue: ghci will be successfully built only if ghc is bootstrapped from the same version.
#Thus we need to detect presently installed one and bootstrap in one or two stages..
