Squeak is a full-featured implementation of the Smalltalk programming language
and environment based on (and largely compatible with) the original Smalltalk-80
system. Squeak has very powerful 2- and 3-D graphics, sound, video, MIDI,
animation and other multimedia capabilities -- and one of the most impressive
development environments ever created. It also includes a customisable framework
for creating dynamic HTTP servers and interactively extensible Web sites. The
entire Squeak system is open source software, distributed freely with a liberal
license.
