*php-4.0.6-r5 ( 22 Feb 2002 )

  22 Feb 2002; Grant Goodyear <g2boojum@gentoo.org> php-4.1.1-r4.ebuild

  Now imap support should work.  Building php w/ imap support requires
  the uw-imap library and headers (from uw-imap or pine).  Annoying
  problem that uw-imap or pine needs to be compiled w/ SSL; otherwise
  the php build will fail due to header problems.

*php-4.0.6-r5 ( 18 Feb 2002 )

  18 Feb 2002; Karl Trygve Kalleberg <karltk@gentoo.org> php-4.0.6-r4.ebuild

  As Java support fails to work with Blackdown, and the fix seems non-trivial,
  Java support is removed from PHP 4.0.6 altogether.

  Old revisions have been removed.

*php-4.0.6-r4 ( 12 Feb 2002 )

  12 Feb 2002; Karl Trygve Kalleberg <karltk@gentoo.org> php-4.0.6-r4.ebuild

  Java support is back. The ebuild also tries harder to follow the style 
  guide.

  Old revisions have been removed.

*php-4.1.1-r3 ( 18 Feb 2002 )

  18 Feb 2002; Karl Trygve Kalleberg <karltk@gentoo.org> php-4.1.1-r3.ebuild

  Java is still here, but now it actually works with Blackdown as well.

  Old revisions have been removed.

*php-4.1.1-r2 ( 12 Feb 2002 )

  12 Feb 2002; Karl Trygve Kalleberg <karltk@gentoo.org> php-4.1.1-r2.ebuild

  Java support is back. The ebuild also tries harder to follow the style 
  guide.

  Old revisions have been removed.

*php-4.1.1 (1 Feb 2002)

  6 Feb 2002; Grant Goodyear <g2boojum@gentoo.org>:
  
  Added a new -r1 revision of the php-4.1.1 ebuild that adds
  two new USE variables, mcrypt and mhash.

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
  
  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
