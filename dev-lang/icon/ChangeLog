  27 Mar 2006; Ferris McCormick <fmccor@gentoo.org> icon-9.4.3.ebuild:
  Add sparc keyword (Bug #114944).  This seems the least bad of several options:
  For me, the "stable" version 9.40 flat out won't build; instead, it goes into
  a '/bin/sh: line 0: cd: gpacks/README: Not a directory' loop.  The requested
  version --- 9.4.3 --- builds and installs, but a couple of its tests fail with
  FEATURES=test enabled.  But in this case, I'll mark it stable, just to help
  get rid of 9.40.  (Note that my system is x11-base/xorg-x11-7.0-r1.)

*icon-9.4.3 (27 Mar 2006)

  27 Mar 2006; George Shapovalov <george@gentoo.org> +icon-9.4.3.ebuild:
  new version. Install is more FHS and upstream frendly and fixes possible
  collisions. Updated modular X dependencies. See #125258 for more details.
  Thanks to Cheyenne Wills for sorting out many issues.
