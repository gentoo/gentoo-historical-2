*oxygen-gtk3-1.1.2 (07 Feb 2013)

  07 Feb 2013; Jason A. Donenfeld <zx2c4@gentoo.org> +metadata.xml,
  +oxygen-gtk3-1.1.2.ebuild:
  oxygen-gtk3 has lived in the kde overlay for a while as a 9999 package. The
  project is now making regular stable versioned releases, which means it's a
  good time to add this to our tree.
