  mplayer-skins-0.1.ebuild files/digest-mplayer-skins-0.1 :

  Installs all the skins for mplayer that are available from their site.
  The only skin not installed is the default skin, because the mplayer
  ebuild itself installs that one.  Thanks to: terjekv@math.uio.no (Terje
  Kvernes) in bug #12277 for the ebuild.
