*bitchx-1.0.19-r3 (11 Nov 2002)

  19 Nov 2002; phoen][x <phoenix@gentoo.org> bitchx-1.0.19-r3.ebuild :
  Added "-fPIC" to C(XX)FLAGS on alpha boxes. This fixes bug 10932.
  Thanks to bjb for the help.
  
  21 Oct 2002; phoen][x <phoenix@gentoo.org> bitchx-1.0.19-r3.ebuild,
  files/digest-bitchx-1.0.19-r3 :
  Used sed to patch include/config.h. BitchX now compiles with #define LATIN1 ON.
  This shouldn't break anything but add support for the standard LATIN1 letters.
  This closes bug #10332.

*bitchx-1.0.19-r2 (26 Jun 2002)

  26 Oct 2002; Jack Morgan <jmorgan@gentoo.org> bitchx-1.0.19-r2.ebuild :
  Added Sparc/sparc64 keywords
  
  21 Oct 2002; phoen][x <phoenix@gentoo.org> bitchx-1.0.19-r2.ebuild :
  Fixed the flag-o-matic setting. It explicitely replaced -O3 with -O2,
  which made the ebuild fail on -O4++ (which aren't standard gcc settings).
  Flag-o-matic replaces -O[3-9] with -O2 now. 

  03 Oct 2002; Brad Cowan <bcowan@gentoo.org> bitchx-1.0.19-r2.ebuild :
  Added flag-o-matic to change -O3 to -O2 this fixes a segmentation fault
  problem. closes bug #8667

  22 Aug 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> bitchx-1.0.19-r2.ebuild :
  Man page now installs properly (ie, it's readable).  Thanks to:
  stocke2@cox.net (Eric Stockbridge) in bug #6720.

  16 Jul 2002; Ben Lutgens <lamer@gentoo.org> ChangeLog  :
  Commented out the "use socks5" stuff because bitchx is being lame and
  doesn't work with any packaged socks implementations in the tree :-(

  26 Jun 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> bitchx-1.0.19-r1.ebuild
