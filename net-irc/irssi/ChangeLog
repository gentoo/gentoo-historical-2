irssi-0.8.5-r1 (15 Jul 2002)

  24 Jul 2002; Mark Guertin <gerk@gentoo.org> :
  Added ppc to keywords

  15 Jul 2002; Ben Lutgens <lamer@gentoo.org> ChangeLog  :

  incremented the version number. Anyone with socks in use gets an additional
  depend on net-misc/dante-1.1.13. It's needed for libsocks.so and socks.h
  (otherwise toggling the option --with-socks does no good) needs more socks
  testing however so it's getting masked)
