  7 Aug 2002; Ryan Phillips <rphillips@gentoo.org> : 
  Changed package to use system libpng. PHP doesn't like being
  linked to two separate places.
  
  Edward Roper states, "php.net indicates it's a conflict of 
  pdflib's png support and libpng... if pdflib is compiled to use 
  system libpng and not internal libpng it will supposedly work..."

  Which he then verified.

  3 Apr 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> : New revision -- we dodir
  /usr/bin (required for make install), closing bug 1498.  Also, now some
  installation steps requiring java are conditional on the java USE variable
  being set.

*pdflib-4.0.1-r2 (1 Feb 2002)

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
