		A free, GPL-2, non-interactive software package for producing plots,
		charts, and graphics from data. It was developed in a Unix/C
		environment and runs on various Unix, Linux, and win32 systems.
		ploticus is good for automated or just-in-time graph generation,
		handles date and time data nicely, and has basic statistical
		capabilities. It allows significant user control over colors, styles,
		options and details.
