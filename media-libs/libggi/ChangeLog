*libggi-2.0.1 (05 Jun 2002)

  05 Jun 2002; Olivier Reisch <doctomoe@gentoo.org> libggi-2.0.1.ebuild

  Added a small patch to the ebuild so libggi compiles fine on Apple PPC
  machines. The vendor figured all PPC machines were embedded and adds a
  compile option for lcd823 (embedded lcd controller) which does not work on
  most PPC machines. Patch disables the option. Fixes BUG #3426.
