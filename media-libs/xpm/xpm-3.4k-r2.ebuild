# Note that this is a dummy package.  It's just a placeholder.  If the
# package which needs xpm needs X11, it doesn't need xpm, because X11
# provides xpm.  This placeholder is only here if it is a non-X package
# which needs xpm,  If this does become non-dummy, it needs to provide a
# virtual/xpm -- to be revisited
