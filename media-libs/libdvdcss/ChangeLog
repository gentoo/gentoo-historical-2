  Bumped to new version, because it was there and it fixes a playing problem
  for me. Notice that it seems to have changed a lot since 1.1.1, so you might
  want to try 1.1.1 to see if that works better for you.

  Ok, this should resolve bug #2908.

  Try to resolve invalid symlink issue (bug #2908), and
  also an issue on certain archs where it could not
  decrypt dvds.
