  files/libmpeg3-gentoo-patch-part2 :

  It seems that the libmpeg3 folks did not design libmpeg3 well for installing
  the header files.  This is unfortunate because a few applications like
  transcode and mplayer need those headers in order to build libmpeg3 support.
  Their src.rpm's however, take care of this problem through patching.  So,
  to this end, I have patched the Makefile in patch-part1 to actually
  install the header files.  And I have patched the header files themselves
  in patch-part2 so that they include one another properly with 
  #include <blah> instead of #include "../blah"  This works well, so far.
