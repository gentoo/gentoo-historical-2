Etox is a type setting and text layout library based on Evas. Etox helps you when it 
comes to displaying, moving, resizing, layering, clipping, aligning and coloring 
fonts in different styles, and more.

A typical application is the need for a text layout engine that can dynamically 
arrange text flow around other graphical obstacles. See the following images 
illustrating just that.
