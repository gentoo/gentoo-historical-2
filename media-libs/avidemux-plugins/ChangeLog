*avidemux-plugins-2.6.4-r1 (12 Jul 2013)

  12 Jul 2013; Tom Wijsman <TomWij@gentoo.org>
  +avidemux-plugins-2.6.4-r1.ebuild,
  +files/avidemux-plugins-2.6.4-optional-pulse.patch, metadata.xml:
  Revision bump. Fix up dependencies that are enabled by default as well as
  those that are disabled by default; they were not automagic as checks were
  present, I just did not notice them. This was incorrect due to wrongly
  checking the dependencies in my early developer days, as well as adding the
  cmake arguments in a sub phase of the configure phase instead of for the whole
  configure phase; I need to make sure I check USE="-*" and USE="*" in the
  future and look closer at cmake files to avoid this. Fixes bug #476602,
  reported by Nikoli.

  07 Jul 2013; Tom Wijsman <TomWij@gentoo.org> avidemux-plugins-2.6.2-r2.ebuild,
  avidemux-plugins-2.6.3.ebuild, avidemux-plugins-2.6.4.ebuild:
  Add sub slot operator for media-libs/x264 dependency.

*avidemux-plugins-2.6.4 (16 May 2013)

  16 May 2013; Tom Wijsman <TomWij@gentoo.org> +avidemux-plugins-2.6.4.ebuild:
  Version bump to 2.6.4.

  16 May 2013; Tom Wijsman <TomWij@gentoo.org> avidemux-plugins-2.6.2-r2.ebuild,
  avidemux-plugins-2.6.3.ebuild:
  If avidemux-plugins will be build with qt4, avidemux needs to have that USE
  flag set as well.

*avidemux-plugins-2.6.3 (29 Mar 2013)

  29 Mar 2013; Tom Wijsman <TomWij@gentoo.org> +avidemux-plugins-2.6.3.ebuild,
  metadata.xml:
  Version bump to 2.6.3. Reworked USE flags to be more specific to each avidemux
  package, the way it is meant to be; introduced additional support for some
  libraries through USE flags as a consequence.

*avidemux-plugins-2.6.2-r2 (24 Mar 2013)

  24 Mar 2013; Tom Wijsman <TomWij@gentoo.org>
  +avidemux-plugins-2.6.2-r2.ebuild, -avidemux-plugins-2.6.2-r1.ebuild:
  Revision bump. Now that the package is revised, the install target for
  avidemux-plugins became available because avidemux is seen as present on the
  system; changed preinstall to install in the avidemux-plugins ebuild such that
  the plugins are properly installed. Fixes bug #462514 and bug #462516.

*avidemux-plugins-2.6.2-r1 (20 Mar 2013)

  20 Mar 2013; Tom Wijsman <TomWij@gentoo.org>
  +avidemux-plugins-2.6.2-r1.ebuild, +metadata.xml:
  New package: Removed gtk USE flag, fixes bug #461988. Split plugins to its own
  package, fixes bug #462098.
