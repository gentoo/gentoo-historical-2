*gdk-pixbuf-0.18.0 (19 Jun 2002)

  19 Jun 2002; Gabriele Giorgetti <stroke@gentoo.org> gdk-pixbuf-0.18.0.ebuild:

  Version bump.

*gdk-pixbuf-0.17.0 (05 Jun 2002)

  05 Jun 2002; Olivier R. <doctomoe@gentoo.org> gdk-pixbuf-0.17.0.ebuild:

  Added media-libs/imlib as dependency, as it is needed to compile properly.

*gdk-pixbuf-0.17.0 (20 Apr 2002)

*gdk-pixbuf-0.16.0-r9 (12 Apr 2002)

  12 Apr 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> gdk-pixbuf-0.16.0-r9.ebuild:

  Updated to depend on the new libpng (which requires that this be recompiled
  against that).

*gdk-pixbuf-0.16.0-r8 (8 Apr 2002)

  8 Apr 2002; M.Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> gdk-pixbuf-0.16.0-r8.ebuild :

  Change to use the "virtualx" eclass. Some cleanups.

  3 Apr 2002; M.Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> gdk-pixbuf-0.16.0-r7.ebuild :

  Remove unneeded auto* stuff.

*gdk-pixbuf-0.16.0-r7 (2 Apr 2002)

  2 Apr 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> gdk-pixbuf-0.16.0-r7.ebuild :

  For the record: blocke is a sheer genius.  His idea was to look at an RPM, so
  I had a look at Mandrake's src.rpm, and lo! David BAUDENS 
  <baudens@mandrakesoft.com> had a fix for compiling without the display.

*gdk-pixbuf-0.16.0-r6 (31 Mar 2002)

  31 Mar 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> gdk-pixbuf-0.16.0-r6.ebuild:

  GNOME support is no longer an option -- it is built-in automatically, because
  downstream applications tend to expect it in this package.

*gdk-pixbuf-0.16.0-r5 (16 Mar 2002)

  16 Mar 2002; M.Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> :

  Libtoolize to fix "rebuild" bug.

  17 Feb 2002; M.Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> gdk-pixbuf-0.16.0-r4.ebuild :

  Fix the build to do the libraries in /usr/lib/gdk-pixbuf/loaders/ properly the
  first time.  This is hackish at the moment, but seems to be a upstream
  problem.  This should resolve the need to remerge gdk-pixbuf twice to get
  mentioned libraries.

*gdk-pixbuf-0.16.0-r1 (1 Feb 2002)

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
  
  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
