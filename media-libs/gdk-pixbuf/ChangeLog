  For the record: blocke is a sheer genius.  His idea was to look at an RPM, so

  Fix the build to do the libraries in /usr/lib/gdk-pixbuf/loaders/ properly the
  first time.  This is hackish at the moment, but seems to be a upstream
  problem.  This should resolve the need to remerge gdk-pixbuf twice to get
  mentioned libraries.

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :

  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
