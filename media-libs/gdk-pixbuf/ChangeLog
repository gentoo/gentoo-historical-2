  17 Feb 2002; M.Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> gdk-pixbuf-0.16.0-r4.ebuild :

  Fix the build to do the libraries in /usr/lib/gdk-pixbuf/loaders/ properly the
  first time.  This is hackish at the moment, but seems to be a upstream
  problem.  This should resolve the need to remerge gdk-pixbuf twice to get
  mentioned libraries.

*gdk-pixbuf-0.16.0-r1 (1 Feb 2002)

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
