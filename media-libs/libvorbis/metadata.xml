	<flag name='aotuv'>Applies the aoTuV patches. Aoyumi's Tuned Vorbis is 
		a third-party patchset that improves the vorbis encoding quality.
		A previous version of the aoTuV patchset has already been merged with 
		the official libvorbis release. The current patchset especially 
		improves encoding quality at low bitrate settings, and is very likely
		to be merged at some point in the future. It is recommended that all 
		users enable this useflag.
