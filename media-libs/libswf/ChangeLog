  19 Jun 2003; Joshua Kinard <kumba@gentoo.org> libswf-0.99.ebuild:
  Changed sparc to -sparc and added -mips to KEYWORDS, as this lib "seems" to be
  x86-only.  ppc and hppa people should double check this lib and mask as
  appropriate.

  Hopefully fixed bug 20346 (problem while unpacking, seems default unpack
  changed behaviour)

  06 Dec 2002; Rodney Rees <manson@gentoo.org> : changed sparc ~sparc keywords

  outlined by wongs15@tartarus.uwa.edu.au (Steven Wong) in bug #6092

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
  
  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
