*frodo-4.1 (17 Apr 2003)

  17 Apr 2003; Dylan Carlson <absinthe@gentoo.org> frodo-4.1.ebuild,
  files/frodo-4.1-gentoo.diff:
  Initial import. This build isn't the cleanest thing, but it's mostly
  functional. I need some volunteers to help test and improve it.  Please
  send in bug reports and patches to http://bugs.gentoo.org.

  x86 ppc and sparc masked for testing.
