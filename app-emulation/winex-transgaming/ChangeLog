  24 Feb 2002; phoen][x <phoenix@gentoo.org> winex-transgaming-2.2.1.ebuild :
  Updated ebuild. Thanks to Max Kalika <alkern23@yahoo.com> for the contribution.
  This closes bug #11023.

  18 Feb 2002; phoen][x <phoenix@gentoo.org> ChangeLog, winex-transgaming-2.2.1.ebuild,
  digest-winex-transgaming-2.2.1 :
  Initial import.  Ebuild submitted by Max Kalika <alkern23@yahoo.com> (bug #11023).
  This ebuild gives users the possibility, to install transgamings winex distribution.
  In order to install it, you have to fetch the winex tarball from the transgaming download-
  section (http://www.transgaming.com/download.php) - you must be an official transgaming 
  subscriber to enter the download area, though. This package currently blocks 
  app-emulation/winex (they share the same locations, and cannot be installed at the same time).
  Do not mail Max or me - we will not give you the tarball.
