		SheepShaver is a MacOS run-time environment for BeOS and Linux that
		allows you to run classic MacOS applications inside the BeOS/Linux
		multitasking environment. This means that both BeOS/Linux and MacOS
		applications can run at the same time (usually in a window on the
		BeOS/Linux desktop) and data can be exchanged between them. If you are
		using a PowerPC-based system, applications will run at native speed
		(i.e. with no emulation involved). There is also a built-in PowerPC
		emulator for non-PowerPC systems.
