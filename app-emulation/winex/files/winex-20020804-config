WINE REGISTRY Version 2
;; All keys relative to \\Machine\\Software\\Wine\\Wine\\Config

;; If you think it is nescessary to show others your complete config for a 
;; bug report, filter out empty lines and comments with
;; grep -v "^;" ~/.wine/config | grep '.' 
;;
;; MS-DOS drives configuration
;;
;; Each section has the following format:
;; [Drive X]
;; "Path"="xxx"       (Unix path for drive root)
;; "Type"="xxx"       (supported types are 'floppy', 'hd', 'cdrom' and 'network')
;; "Label"="xxx"      (drive label, at most 11 characters)
;; "Serial"="xxx"     (serial number, 8 characters hexadecimal number)
;; "Filesystem"="xxx" (supported types are 'msdos'/'dos'/'fat', 'win95'/'vfat', 'unix')
;;   This is the FS Wine is supposed to emulate on a certain
;;   directory structure.
;;   Recommended:
;;   - "win95" for ext2fs, VFAT and FAT32
;;   - "msdos" for FAT16 (ugly, upgrading to VFAT driver strongly recommended)
;;   DON'T use "unix" unless you intend to port programs using Winelib !
;; "Device"="/dev/xx" (only if you want to allow raw device access)
;;
