  06 Dec 2002; Rodney Rees <manson@gentoo.org> : changed sparc ~sparc keywords
 
*winex-20021123 (23 Nov 2002)
  23 Nov 2002; phoen][x <phoenix@gentoo.org> winex-20021123.ebuild, 
  files/digest-winex-20021123, files/winex-20021123-misc, 
  files/winex-20021123-fake_windows :
  New snapshot of winex-2.2.1. Updated the files/-layout:
  winex, winex-regedit and config are in ${PN}-misc.tar.bz2 now.  The fake_windows 
  has been deleted from ${SRC_URI} and also resides in files/ now. The idea is, that 
  all dynamic data goes into files/. Modified the ebuild to reflect these changes. 

*winex-20021011 (11 Oct 2002)
  
  11 Oct 2002; phoen][x <phoenix@gentoo.org> winex-20021011.ebuild, 
  files/digest-winex-20021011, files/winex-20021011-config,
  files/winex-20021011-regedit, files/winex-20021011-winex :
  New version of winex (2.2). Disabled the build of programs/ because there
  were some major problems with the rc-files. If you find a way to work around
  that, tell me how you did it. I gave up after one hour.

*winex-20020807-r1 (13 Sep 2002)
  
  13 Sep 2002; phoen][x <phoenix@gentoo.org> winex-20020807-r1.ebuild :
  Added manpage installation. This installs the manpage of wine as ${PN}.

*winex-20020807 (19 Aug 2002)

  07 Sep 2002; phoen][x <phoenix@gentoo.org> winex-20020807.ebuild :
  Renamed the regedit wrapper to "/usr/bin/regedit-winex".

  04 Sep 2002; Nick Hadaway <raker@gentoo.org> files/81winex,
  files/winex-20020807-config :
  Updated LDPATH, PATH, and ROOTPATH in 81winex and added a drive H
  to the default config.

  06 Aug 2002; phoen][x <phoenix@gentoo.org> winex-20020807.ebuild:
  Bumped to new CVS Version (WineX 2.1). Lets hope that this
  will fix some of the weird winex issues.  

*winex-20020804 (04 Aug 2002)

  19 August 2002; Sascha Schwabbauer <cybersystem@gentoo.org> ChangeLog, winex-20020804.ebuild :
  Added -ppc to the keywords.

  06 Aug 2002; phoen][x <phoenix@gentoo.org> winex-20020804.ebuild:
  Fixed a typo (unset CFLAGS=""); patched tools/wineshelllink to use "winex"
  instead of "wine" - Installation programs are now able to create working
  Desktop Icons and Menu shortcuts.

  06 Aug 2002; phoen][x <phoenix@gentoo.org> files/winex-20020804-config :
  Disabled DGA for the default config (There are rumours that it breaks 
  directdraw (besides, most users dont have the proper permissions in /dev/mem))

  04 Aug 2002; phoen][x <phoenix@gentoo.org> winex-20020804.ebuild :
  Added regedit script.

  04 Aug 2002; phoen][x <phoenix@gentoo.org> winex-20020804.ebuild :
  Fixed the install location of generic.ppd and system.ini.
  They go to /usr/lib/winex/.data/fake_windows/Windows now.

  04 Aug 2002; phoen][x <phoenix@gentoo.org> winex-20020804.ebuild,
  files/digest-winex-20020804, files/winex-20020804-config, files/winex-20020804-winex :

  Bumped to the new CVS Version (WineX 2.0). The ebuild changed a lot. We dont need
  /etc/winex anymore, because the wrapper-script (/usr/bin/winex) sets up ~/.winex 
  automagically. Everything else resides in /usr/lib/winex now.

*winex-20020628 (28 Jun 2002)

  28 Jun 2002; J.Alberto Suárez L. <bass@gentoo.org> winex-20020728.ebuild:
