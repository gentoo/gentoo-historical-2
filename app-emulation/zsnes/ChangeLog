*zsnes-1.26 (21 Jul 2002)

  21 Jul 2002; Dan Armak <danarmak@gentoo.org> ChangeLog  :

  New upstream version.
  

  20 Jul 2002; Phil Bordelon <sunflare@gentoo.org> zsnes-1.35.ebuild zsnes-1.35-r1.ebuild zsnes-1.337-r2.ebuild :

  ZSNES relies on x86 assembly, and will not build on PPC, SPARC, or
  SPARC64 platforms.  Updated the KEYWORDS to reflect this.

*zsnes-1.35-r1 (08 Jul 2002)

  11 Jul 2002; Brandon Low <lostlogic@gentoo.org> zsnes-1.35-r1.ebuild :

  Just fix the ebuild to die if patching fails.

  08 Jul 2002; Phil Bordelon <sunflare@gentoo.org> zsnes-1.35-r1.ebuild zsnes-1.337-r2.ebuild :

  There are a number of problems with raw ZSNES 1.35.  Thomas Weidner
  alerted us to the problem and submitted both a patch against ZSNES
  CVS and an updated ebuild.  Changed the description string, but
  otherwise the ebuild is identical.  See Bug #4704 for details.

  I also updated zsnes-1.337-r2.ebuild to make repoman happy.

*zsnes-1.35 (06 Jul 2002)

  06 Jul 2002; Phil Bordelon <sunflare@gentoo.org> zsnes-1.35.ebuild :

  Updated to the latest version.  Brought the ebuild up to current repoman
  and lintool specs.  The patch in -r2 is no longer needed.  The Author in
  the ebuild was Dan Armak.

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
  
  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
