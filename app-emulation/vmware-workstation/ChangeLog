  11 Apr 2002; William McArthur <sandymac@gentoo.org> vmware-workstation-3.1.1.1790.ebuild:
  New version of VMware Workstation released. The ebuild was updated for this
  version. The Gentoo (/etc/init.d/vmware) init script was changed to capture
  the output from the VMware (/etc/vmware/init.d/vmware) script and prettify
  (Is that a word?) it's output to look more like the Gentoo boot output. Also,
  any error lines from the vmware init script are sent to the system logger to
  hopefully increase their chance of being noticed. I made an icon from the
  logo off of vmware.com for use in "start" type menus. It can be found in
  /opt/vmware/lib/icon/ .  If kde is in the USE var then menu items are
  automatically added for the user.

*vmware-workstation-3.0.0.1455-r1 (20 Feb 2002)

  20 Feb 2002; William McArthur <sandymac@gentoo.org> vmware-workstation-3.0.0.1455-r1.ebuild :
  If you had an existing vmware install there was a problem where the file 
  /etc/vmware/not_configured would have a mtime different from what was in the
  locations file. This is fixed by not having a mtime in the locations file for
  the not_configured file.

  At the end of the merge the new locations file is appended to the existing
  locations. This plus the above should solve any problems that people with
  manual vmware installs have.

  If the user was to merge vmware twice without running vmware-config.pl the
  rc#.d dirs in /etc/vmware/init.d/ would be remove despite config protection.
  To keep them around I added .keep files in each of them.

*vmware-workstation-3.0.0.1455 (10 Feb 2002)

  10 Feb 2002; William McArthur <sandymac@gentoo.org> vmware-workstation-3.0.0.1455.ebuild :
  I don't remember the details but the following was written:

  The ebuild bypassed the official install because it doesn't all a install
  prefix.  Basicly the files from the work dir are copyied to the image dir.

  DEBUG=true is set because the strip command line tool dumps core on the
  vmware executable and setting DEBUG will disable it.

  After the files have had their mtime updated we scan the image dir and collect
  the mtimes and add the info to the /etc/vmware/locations file. This file is
  used by vmware to track config choices and it is used in upgrading. By
  creating this file we make sure the vmware config tools work and I think you
  could do a non gentoo package install of vmware and it would work.

  The vmware-config tool insists on a set of init dirs named rc#.d so they are
  created in /etc/vmware/init.d/ . The other option was edit vmware-config.pl .

  VMWare needs some modules loaded so at boot an init script is run that is
  really just glue to start the init script supplied from vmware which is at
  /etc/vmware/init.d/vmware
