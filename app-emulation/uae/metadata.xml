		Commodore Amiga 500/1000/2000. A Commodore Amiga is a 16/32 bit computer
		system based on the Motorola 680x0 CPU and a few specially designed
		custom chips that provide very good graphics and sound capabilities. It's
		first incarnation, the A1000, appeared in 1985, followed by the highly
		successful A500 and A2000 models.
