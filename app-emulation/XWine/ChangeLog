*XWine-0.3.ebuild (13 Mar 2002)

  13 Mar 2002; phoen][x <phoenix@gentoo.org> XWine-0.3.ebuild :
  Verison bump. This ebuild fixes problems with the interactive configure
  and ends the gnome dependency trouble: XWine depends on gnome, there's no
  way to compile it without gnome-libs being installed.

*XWine-0.2.2.ebuild (17 Aug 2002)

  03 Sep 2002; Nick Hadaway <raker@gentoo.org> XWine-0.2.2.ebuild :
  Changed to econf and einstall.  Added myconf switches for gnome and
  nls support.  Changed dependancy from libgnome to gnome-libs and
  ORBit.

  19 Aug 2002; Nick Hadaway <raker@gentoo.org> XWine-0.2.2.ebuild :
  Updated ebuild to not install /usr/share/doc/winex and associated
  files.  These are already taken care of by dodoc.
