*atari800-1.2.2 (24 Feb 2002)

  24 Feb 2002; Rob McMullen <robm@flipturn.org> atari800-1.2.2.ebuild:

  Atari 8-bit emulator (400/800/1200/XL/XE etc.) that will be compiled
  with SDL if 'sdl' appears in your USE statement, otherwise as an X11
  app.  SDL switches to fullscreen mode by default, so a 400x300 entry
  into your XF86Config-4 file is recommended.
