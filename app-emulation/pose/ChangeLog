*pose-3.5-r1 (07 Aug 2003)

  07 Aug 2003; George Shapovalov <george@gentoo.org> pose-3.5-r2.ebuild :
  A weird fix to the fltk problem. Need to have both installed later fltk version 
  and local 1.0.11 in order to build successfully. Will keep it like this for now (#5219)

  30 Mar 2003; George Shapovalov <george@gentoo.org> pose-3.5-r1.ebuild :
  statick version ceased building at some point. (#5219)
  This is a fix that disables profile version of pose but allows to get "normal" version working.

  checked, did few cosmetic fixes and committed

  28 Aug 2002; David Mott <austmighty@yahoo.com> :
  Changed whole ebuild structure. Now compiles statically.
  A bit of a kludge but it works. Based on John Marshall's
  rpm.spec file for POSE.

  POSE.
