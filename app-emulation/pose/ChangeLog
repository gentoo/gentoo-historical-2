  30 Mar 2003; George Shapovalov <george@gentoo.org> pose-3.5-r1.ebuild :
  statick version ceased building at some point. (#5219)
  This is a fix that disables profile version of pose but allows to get "normal" version working.

  checked, did few cosmetic fixes and committed

  A bit of a kludge but it works. Based on John Marshall's
  rpm.spec file for POSE.
