  5 Mar 2002; Dan Armak <danarmak@gentoo.org> Changelog:
  
  This is the latest snapshot. I've rewritten the ebuild, fixing all known issues,
  including the compilation failures.
  
  Among the fixes are: install into /usr not /opt/wine, compile and install the manpages,
  handle the onfig file correctly (there'll be a winesetuptk ebuild sometime soon), and more.

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
  
  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
