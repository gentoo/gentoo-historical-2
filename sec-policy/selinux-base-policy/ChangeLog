*selinux-base-policy-20031225 (25 Dec 2003)

  25 Dec 2003; Chris PeBenito <pebenito@gentoo.org>
  selinux-base-policy-20031225.ebuild:
  New release, with merged NSA 1.4 policy. One critical note, this policy
  requires pam 0.77. Much work has been done to minimize access to /etc/shadow,
  and one requirement is in the patch for pam 0.77. If you do not use this pam
  version or newer, you will be unable to authenticate in enforcing. Since
  devfs no longer is usable in SELinux, it's policy has been removed. You
  should merge the changes, remove the devfsd policy (devfsd.te and devfsd.fc),
  load the policy, and relabel.

  27 Nov 2003; Chris PeBenito <pebenito@gentoo.org>
  selinux-base-policy-20031010-r1.ebuild:
  Mark stable.  Add build USE flag for stage building.

*selinux-base-policy-20031010-r1 (12 Nov 2003)

  12 Nov 2003; Chris PeBenito <pebenito@gentoo.org>
  selinux-base-policy-20031010-r1.ebuild,
  files/selinux-base-policy-20031010-cvs.diff:
  Add fixes from policy cvs for compilers, so non x86 and ppc compilers can
  work. Also portage update as a side effect of updated setfiles code in
  portage, from bug 31748.

*selinux-base-policy-20030729-r1 (31 Jul 2003)

  31 Jul 2003; Chris PeBenito <pebenito@gentoo.org>
  selinux-base-policy-20030729-r1.ebuild:
  New rev that handles an empty POLICYDIR sanely.

*selinux-base-policy-20030729 (29 Jul 2003)

  29 Jul 2003; Chris PeBenito <pebenito@gentoo.org>
  selinux-base-policy-20030729.ebuild:
  Make the ebuild use POLICYDIR. Important fix so portage can load policy so
  selinux-policy.eclass works. update_modules_t cleanup. Fix for an access when
  merging baselayout.

*selinux-base-policy-20030720 (20 Jul 2003)

  20 Jul 2003; Chris PeBenito <pebenito@gentoo.org>
  selinux-base-policy-20030720.ebuild:
  Many fixes, including the syslog fix. File contexts have changed, so a relabel
  is needed. You may encounter problems relabeling /usr/portage, as its file
  context has changed, as files should not have the same type as a domain.
  Relabelling in permissive will fix this, or temporarily give portage_t a
  file_type attribute. Tightened the can_exec_any() macro. Moved staff.fc to
  users.fc, since all users with SELinux identities should have their home
  directories have the correct identity, not the generic identity.

  06 Jun 2003; Chris PeBenito <pebenito@gentoo.org>
  selinux-base-policy-20030604.ebuild:
  Mark stable

*selinux-base-policy-20030604 (04 Jun 2003)

  04 Jun 2003; Chris PeBenito <pebenito@gentoo.org>
  selinux-base-policy-20030604.ebuild:
  Fix broken 20030603

  04 Jun 2003; Chris PeBenito <pebenito@gentoo.org>
  selinux-base-policy-20030603.ebuild:
  Pulling 20030603, as there are problems, 20030604 later today

*selinux-base-policy-20030603 (03 Jun 2003)

  03 Jun 2003; Chris PeBenito <pebenito@gentoo.org>
  selinux-base-policy-20030603.ebuild:
  Numerous various fixes. Added staff role. Removed ipsec, gpm and gpg policies
  as they are not appropriate for the base policy, and untested.

*selinux-base-policy-20030522 (22 May 2003)

  22 May 2003; Chris PeBenito <pebenito@gentoo.org>
  selinux-base-policy-20030522.ebuild:
  The policy is in pretty good shape now. I've been able to run in enforcing mode
  with little problem. I've also been able to successfully merge and unmerge
  packages in enforcing mode, with few exceptions (why does mysql need to run ps
  during configure?).

*selinux-base-policy-20030514 (14 May 2003)

  14 May 2003; Chris PeBenito <pebenito@gentoo.org>
  selinux-base-policy-20030514.ebuild:
  Many improvements in many areas. Of note, rlogind policies were removed. Klogd
  is being merged into syslogd. The portage policy is much more complete, but
  still needs work. Its suggested that all changes be merged in, policy
  reloaded, then relabel.
