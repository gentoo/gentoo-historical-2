  11 Jul 2002; Dan <overridex@punkass.com> falconseye-1.9.3.ebuild-r1:
  Changed the default config to point at /usr/bin/timidity rather
  than /usr/local/bin/timidity since that's where it gets installed.

  Enabled some defines to use gzip for saved game compression (the
  ebuild down has a runtime dependency for gzip).

  Fixes a problem with some systems (hardware related?) where the
  music player program would switch songs too quickly leaving <defunct> processes,
  after a few of these built up it would cause saving games to fail, this will be
  included in the next falconseye upstream release whenever that is.

  Added support to the /usr/bin/falconseye script to look for
  options in ~/.falconseyerc, and if it doesn't exist create it with some basic
  options.
