  From the ebuild author:

  Cheetah is a Python-powered template engine and code generator. It may be used
  as a standalone utility or combined with other tools. Cheetah has many potential
  uses, but web developers looking for a viable alternative to ASP, JSP, PHP and
  PSP are expected to be its principle user group.
