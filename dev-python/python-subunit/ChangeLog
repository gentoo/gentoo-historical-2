*python-subunit-0.0.15 (10 Dec 2013)

  10 Dec 2013; Ian Delaney <idella4@gentoo.org> +metadata.xml,
  +python-subunit-0.0.15.ebuild:
  A cut down clone of dev-python/subunit for python only, its need spawned by
  openstack packages' testsuites.  The packages arguably should have always been
  named python-subunit
