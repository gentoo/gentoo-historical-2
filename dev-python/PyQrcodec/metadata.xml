  PyQrCodec is a Python module for encoding and decoding QrCode images.
  PyQrCodec wraps encoding library libqrencode by Fukuchi kentaro and decoding library libdecodeqr
  by Nishi Takao, the former being a C library and the latter a C++ library. The implementation of
  the libraries in native code makes both the encoding and decoding very quick.
