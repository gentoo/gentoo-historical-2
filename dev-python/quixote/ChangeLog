*quixote-0.6_beta2 (21 Apr 2003)

  21 Apr 2003; Grant Goodyear <g2boojum@gentoo.org> quixote-0.5.1.ebuild,
  quixote-0.6_beta2.ebuild, quixote-0.6_beta6.ebuild:
  New python web framework. Marked stable for 0.5.1 because I've used it.
  Leaving the beta's marked unstable, since they're still beta.
  That said, I highly recommend that all users who want to use quixote
  use the latest beta, as there have been some significant changes.
  (If it's good enough for LWN, it's good enough for me.)
