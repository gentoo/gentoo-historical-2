	* Hash functions: MD2, MD4, RIPEMD, SHA256.
	* Block encryption algorithms: AES, ARC2, Blowfish, CAST, DES,
		Triple-DES, IDEA, RC5.
	* Stream encryption algorithms: ARC4, simple XOR.
	* Public-key algorithms: RSA, DSA, ElGamal, qNEW.
	* Protocols: All-or-nothing transforms, chaffing/winnowing.
	* Miscellaneous: RFC1751 module for converting 128-key keys into
