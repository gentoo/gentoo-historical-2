  Twisted.Web2 is the next generation Web Server Framework built with
  Twisted. Web2 is under active development and it's APIs should not
  be considered stable at this point. It is not a version of
  Twisted.Web and with that in mind compatibility is not of the
  highest concern, though the compatibility layer does support many
  but not all twisted.web resources.
