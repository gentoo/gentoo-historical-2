IPython provides a replacement for the interactive Python interpreter with
extra functionality.

Main features:
* Comprehensive object introspection.
* Input history, persistent across sessions.
* Caching of output results during a session with automatically generated
  references.
* Readline based name completion.
* Extensible system of 'magic' commands for controlling the environment and
  performing many tasks related either to IPython or the operating system.
* Configuration system with easy switching between different setups (simpler
  than changing $PYTHONSTARTUP environment variables every time).
* Session logging and reloading.
* Extensible syntax processing for special purpose situations.
* Access to the system shell with user-extensible alias system.
* Easily embeddable in other Python programs.
* Integrated access to the pdb debugger and the Python profiler.
