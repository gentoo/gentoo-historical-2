  What Is Twisted?
  An Application Suite

  Twisted is a collection of servers and clients, which can be used
  either by developers of new applications or directly. Instance Messenger
  and Twisted Web are both available out of the box as applications for
  the desktop user. 

  A Development Tool

  Twisted is a framework, written in Python, for writing networked
  applications. It includes implementations of a number of commonly used
  network services such as a web server, an IRC chat server, a mail
  server, a relational database interface and an object broker. Developers
  can build applications using all of these services as well as custom
  services that they write themselves. Twisted also includes a user
  authentication system that controls access to services and provides
  services with user context information to implement their own security
  models. 

  An Integrated Environment

  Twisted is an integration point for network services that were
  previously unable to interoperate. Services within a Twisted server can
  communicate with each other and share information providing a very
  integrated programming environment that can re-use large amounts of
  infrastructure across multiple network mediums (such as chat, web, and
  mail).

  As well as servers, Twisted supports several different kinds of
  clients and GUIs. This means that the client can re-use large portions
  of the server's code, improving test coverage and reliability while
  reducing code size. 

  All at Once?

  A common reaction to this amount of functionality all in one box is that
  it's overwhelming. Why are chat and web in the same server? Why network
  your client with the same infrastructure that you're using on the
  server? Why give programmers and users the same tool? And how do you
  achieve that while remaining lightweight and minimal-impact?

  At first glance, these are really different problems requiring different
  solutions -- at least, in the traditional way of thinking about them.
  However, the traditional approach to network software development has
  erected artificial barriers between applications. Those barriers prevent
  developers from easily adding useful functionality. As an example,
  putting a web administration interface on your IRC server can be
  difficult, if it's even possible. Once you've done it, chances are you
  can't use that same web server you set up to serve your filesystem.

  Unless you're using Twisted. In that case, your chat server's web
  interface is running with the same industrial strength application
  server that runs your whole web site. The connections are automatic,
  since servers that need to talk to each other already have a robust
  client in them. As a user, you don't need to learn much programming in
  order to enhance your Twisted environment; your favorite new feature is
  just a Python script away.

  And strangely enough, integrating all this functionality reduces bloat.
  Apache, the industry-standard HTTP daemon, weighs in at 3.7 megabytes;
  Twisted is a mere 0.5 megabytes.
