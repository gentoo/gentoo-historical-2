PyCrash is a Run-Time Exception Dumper which handles uncaught exceptions
during the execution of Python programs and collects information about
the program context. PyCrash can be very useful in report bug information,
because the programmer can easily analyse the program execution context
of the crashed application. The format of the crash dump file generated 
by PyCrash is XML, so the programmer can easily read this file to understand
why the program is crashed.
