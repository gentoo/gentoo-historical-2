This package contains a powerful N-dimensional array object, sophisticated (broadcasting) functions, tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code, and useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities.    It derives from the old Numeric code base and can be used as a replacement for Numeric.  It also adds the features introduced by numarray and can be used to replace numarray.
