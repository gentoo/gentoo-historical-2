  Marked stable for x86.

  #13860

  12 Jan 2003; Nick Hadaway <raker@gentoo.org> wxPython-2.4.0.1.ebuild,
  files/digest-wxPython-2.4.0.1 :
  A much needed upgrade.  Works with the latest wxGTK release.
  As we have had much problems with the 2.3.4 wxGTK series I am hoping
  this may actually make into the stable 1.4 release or we need to bump
  back to to 2.3.3 series of wxGTK.

  06 Dec 2002; Rodney Rees <manson@gentoo.org> : changed sparc ~sparc keywords
 
*wxPython-2.3.3.1-r2 (30 Oct 2002)

  Removed all the crap put into the first 2.3.3.1 ebuild to build wxGTK and
  updated the patch to remove glcanvas

  29 Oct 2002; Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org> :

*wxPython-2.3.3.1 (28 Oct 2002)

  28 Oct 2002; Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org> :
  This version bump was nasty rough ...
  They added configure/make scripts to this package now, so mirrored much of
  the configure setup after wxGTK ...

  13 Sep 2002; Nick Hadaway <raker@gentoo.org> wxPython-2.3.2.1-r2.ebuild :

  full-featured ebuild of wxPython.
