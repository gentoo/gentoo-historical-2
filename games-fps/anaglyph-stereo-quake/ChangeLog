*anaglyph-stereo-quake-130100-r1 (06 Oct 2003)

  06 Oct 2003; Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org> :
  A lot to see a lot to do here ...
  First up, ported the SDL fixes found in NPRQuake to this
  so that the game can be used with a mouse ;) #26147.
  Next fixed cflags so that only user defined flags get in.
  Finally, fixed data file finding so the user can be
  anywhere and the game will search the quake-data dir.
