*ut2004-demo-3120-r1 (20 Feb 2004)

  20 Feb 2004; <augustus@gentoo.org> ut2004-demo-3120-r1.ebuild,
  ut2004-demo-3120.ebuild:
  Reverted ut2004-demo-3120.ebuild. The patch should have been in a new
  release so that existing users would get it. I moved the changes to
  ut2004-demo-3120-r1.ebuild and fixed it for AMD64. Please don't break other
  ARCH with changes. -r1 is masked for now on AMD64 until icculus releases
  an AMD64 patch.

  19 Feb 2004; Chris Gianelloni <wolf31o2@gentoo.org> ut2004-demo-3120.ebuild:
  Updated ebuild to include text-to-speech and server browser ping patches from
  icculus.

  15 Feb 2004; Brad House <brad_mssw@gentoo.org> ut2004-demo-3120.ebuild:
  amd64 version has been released, should be on mirrors soon

*ut2004-demo-3120 (13 Feb 2004)

  13 Feb 2004; Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org> :
  Initial import.  Ebuild submitted by me.
