  05 Oct 2004; Chris Gianelloni <wolf31o2@gentoo.org> doom3-1.1.1282.ebuild:
  Added USE=cdinstall to copy files from the CD and made some other changes to
  bring it inline with my current ebuild style. I want to thank vapier for his
  first ebuild, as it took some of the pressure off me. Closing bug #57067.
