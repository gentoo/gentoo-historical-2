+#            On systems with hal-lock, use hal-lock to acquire device
+#            locks prior to running gpartedbin.
 #            This is to prevent devices from being automounted.
 #            File system problems can occur if devices are mounted
 #            prior to the completion of GParted's operations.
 #            See GParted bug #324220

-#  directly (and pokes the kernel to reload the partitioning table)
-#  should lock out automounters by either a) obtaining the
-#  org.freedesktop.Hal.Device.Storage lock on each drive being processed;
-#  or b) obtaining the global org.freedesktop.Hal.Device.Storage lock.
