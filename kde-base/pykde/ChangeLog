*pykde-3.5.0 (09 Dec 2005)
*pykde-3.4.3 (09 Dec 2005)

  09 Dec 2005; Carsten Lohrke <carlo@gentoo.org> +files/configure.py.diff,
  +pykde-3.4.3.ebuild, +pykde-3.5.0.ebuild:
  "Initial" commit. This package is the sibling of dev-python/pykde with the
  difference that the ebuilds of this package will be marked stable in future,
  while dev-python/pykde follows the development more closely and will remain
  unstable in future.
