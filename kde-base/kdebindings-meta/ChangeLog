  27 Feb 2005; Dan Armak <danarmak@gentoo.org>
  kdebindings-meta-3.4.0_rc1.ebuild:
  Fix incorrect dep: dcoppython doesn't have an rc1 ebuild

*kdebindings-meta-3.4.0_rc1 (27 Feb 2005)

  27 Feb 2005; Dan Armak <danarmak@gentoo.org>
  +kdebindings-meta-3.4.0_rc1.ebuild:
  Ebuild for 3.4.0 RC1.

  19 Feb 2005; Dan Armak <danarmak@gentoo.org>
  kdebindings-meta-3.3.2.ebuild, kdebindings-meta-3.4.0_beta2.ebuild:
  Since dcopperl, dcoppython, qtruby and korundum have been moved to SLOT 0
  (bug 80858) and only one version of each can be installed now, the deps here
  are changed to match. This means kdebindings-meta-3.3.2 will work with
  dcopperl-3.4.0. That's better than the alternative of not being able to
  emerge two versions of kdebindings-meta at all.

  11 Feb 2005; Dan Armak <danarmak@gentoo.org>
  kdebindings-meta-3.3.2.ebuild:
  Added x86 (stable) keyword.

*kdebindings-meta-3.4.0_beta1 (06 Feb 2005)

  06 Feb 2005; Dan Armak <danarmak@gentoo.org>
  kdebindings-meta-3.3.1.ebuild, kdebindings-meta-3.3.2.ebuild,
  kdebindings-meta-3.4.0_beta1.ebuild, kdebindings-meta-3.4.0_beta2.ebuild:
  Fix typo in the ebuild: RRDEPEND->RDEPEND. Previously the ebuild didn't do
  anything. Curious that noone seems to have reported this.

*kdebindings-meta-3.4.0_beta2 (05 Feb 2005)

  05 Feb 2005; Dan Armak <danarmak@gentoo.org>
  +kdebindings-meta-3.4.0_beta2.ebuild:
  Ebuild for 3.4.0_beta2. Note that beta2 has NOT been released as of this
  date. This ebuild is for inside testing by the KDE team, and is of course
  package.masked.

*kdebindings-meta-3.3.2 (25 Dec 2004)

  25 Dec 2004; Dan Armak <danarmak@gentoo.org>
  kdebindings-meta-3.3.1.ebuild, +kdebindings-meta-3.3.2.ebuild:
  New ebuild for 3.3.2.

*kdebindings-meta-3.3.1 (06 Nov 2004)

  06 Nov 2004; Dan Armak <danarmak@gentoo.org>
  +kdebindings-meta-3.3.1.ebuild:
  Initial version of the split-up kdebindings ebuilds. Cf.
  kde-metaebuilds.berlios.de. This is a project to split the monolithic kde
  ebuilds into separate ebuilds for separate applications. These ebuilds are
  packaged.masked at first, pending testing.
