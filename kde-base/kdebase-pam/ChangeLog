*kdebase-pam-3.4.0_beta2 (05 Feb 2005)

  05 Feb 2005; Dan Armak <danarmak@gentoo.org>
  +kdebase-pam-3.4.0_beta2.ebuild:
  Ebuild for 3.4.0_beta2. Note that beta2 has NOT been released as of this
  date. This ebuild is for inside testing by the KDE team, and is of course
  package.masked.

*kdebase-pam-4 (03 Feb 2005)

  03 Feb 2005; Dan Armak <danarmak@gentoo.org>
  -kdebase-pam-3.4.0_beta1.ebuild, +kdebase-pam-4.ebuild:
  Changed the ebuild's slot to 0 and its version to 4 (which doesn't stand for
  anything; it just enforces an upgrade from the previous version). Versions
  of KDE will not have separate pam.d files. Bug 16022.

*kdebase-pam-3.4.0_beta1 (15 Jan 2005)

  15 Jan 2005; Dan Armak <danarmak@gentoo.org> +metadata.xml,
  +files/kde-np.pam, +files/kde.pam, +kdebase-pam-3.4.0_beta1.ebuild:
  Adding the split ebuilds to portage. For KDE 3.4, we've created separate
  ebuilds for all the KDE apps.
