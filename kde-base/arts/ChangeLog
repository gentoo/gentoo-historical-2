*arts-1.0.1.20020604 (4 Jun 2002)

  4 Jun 2002; Dan Armak <danarmak@gentoo.org> Changelog :

  This is a snapshot of the KDE CVS's KDE_3_0_x branch from June 6th.
  This branch contains only bugfixes to the 3.0 release (the 3.0.1 release
  was also of this kind).
	
  Update <verwilst>: Filter out "-fomit-frame-pointer" and 
  -fstrength-reduce" on gentoo 1.3+ systems. Arts seems very unstable 
  otherwise (Even compiling something shuts it down )

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
  
  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
