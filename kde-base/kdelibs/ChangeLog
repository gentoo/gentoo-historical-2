  2 May 2002; Dan Armak <danarmak@gentoo.org> changelog:

  6 Apr 2002; Dan Armak <danarmak@gentoo.org> changelog:
  
  Change cups dep to >=1.1.14.

*kdelibs-3.0-r1 (5 Apr 2002)

  5 Apr 2002; Dan Armak <danarmak@gentoo.org> Changelog :
  
  Add --with-fast-malloc=full configure option for a considerable speed improvement.

*kdelibs-3.0 (4 Apr 2002)

  4 Apr 2002; Dan Armak <danarmak@gentoo.org> Changelog :

  KDE 3.0 ebuilds. Based on the well-tested kde3pre ebuild set.
  kdelibs-2.2.2-r4: added SLOT=2.

*kdelibs-2.2.2-r4 (24 Mar 2002)

  24 Mar 2002; Dan Armak <danarmak@gentoo.org> changelog:
  
  Split the env.d file into two, so that when both ked2 and kde3 are installed,
  the KDEDIR of kde3 gets exported (was the other way around till now).

  21 Mar 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> kdelibs-2.2.2-r3.ebuild :

  HTML documentation is now done with dohtml instead of dodoc, so it will not
  get gzipped any longer.  This change is small as compared to the size of this
  package so the revision level for the ebuild was not bumped up.

*kdelibs-2.2.2-r3 (22 Feb 2002)

  1 Feb 2002; Dan Armak <danarmak@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
  
  Added KDEDIRS export to env.d file - will come in handy when several KDEs are
  installed side-by-side. If you're not into that kind of thing, you don't care
  about it and needn't upgrade.
  
  Added support for customizing kde install locations. You probably don't need it,
  in which case you don't want to hear about it. Note: untested support for now,
  but doesn't break anything else.

*kdelibs-2.2.2-r2 (1 Feb 2002)

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
  
  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
