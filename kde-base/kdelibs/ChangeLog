*kdelibs-2.2.2-r3 (22 Feb 2002)

  1 Feb 2002; Dan Armak <danarmak@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
  
  Added KDEDIRS export to env.d file - will come in handy when several KDEs are
  installed side-by-side. If you're not into that kind of thing, you don't care
  about it and needn't upgrade.
  
  Added support for customizing kde install locations. You probably don't need it,
  in which case you don't want to hear about it. Note: untested support for now,
  but doesn't break anything else.

*kdelibs-2.2.2-r2 (1 Feb 2002)

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
  
  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
