  13 Apr 2002; Bart Verwilst <verwilst@gentoo.org>: Make sure the gnome 
  icons are visible when choosing a new icon (under 'other icons'), 
  instead of 3 ugly kde-icons. I won't change the revision for something 
  as trivial as this though :o)

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
  
  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
