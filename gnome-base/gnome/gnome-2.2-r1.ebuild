SLOT="2.0"

# when unmasking for an arch
# double check none of the deps are still masked !
KEYWORDS="x86 ~ppc"

#  Note to developers:
#  This is a wrapper for the complete Gnome2 desktop, 
#  This means all components that a user expects in Gnome2 are present
#  please do not reduce this list further unless 
#  dependencies pull in what you remove.
#  With "emerge gnome" a user expects the full "standard" distribution of Gnome and should be provided with that, consider only installing the parts needed for smaller installations.

# Metacity was choosen as the default window manager because of sawfish's long time of non-working state.

# eog is installed to provide with image previews in nautilus.

# gedit is a core example of Gnome2 platform

# applets will pull in the gnome-panel

# after the blank line are the "complete" list we use for gnome2 betas

# after the second blank line added packages for gnome2.1+ 
# file-roller
