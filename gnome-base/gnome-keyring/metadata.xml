		GNOME Keyring is a collection of components in GNOME that store
		secrets, passwords, keys, certificates and make them available to
		applications. It is integrated with the user's login, so that
		their secret storage can be unlocked when the user logins into their
		session. It is based around a standard called PKCS#11, which is a
		standard way for applications to manage certificates and keys on
		smart cards or secure storage.
