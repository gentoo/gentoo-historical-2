  17 Oct 2003; Brad House <brad_mssw@gentoo.org> gnome-libs-1.4.2.ebuild:
  ok, so it took me a sec to realize : was equivalent to || in C there was deps
  on db < 2 on other arches, just not for amd64. make it all arches now

  17 Oct 2003; Brad House <brad_mssw@gentoo.org> gnome-libs-1.4.2.ebuild:
  seems to require db1 on amd64. surprised it doesn't on other systems, or
  perhaps it's installed by default on other systems and has just never been
  noticed as db1 on amd64 was just unmasked. Also remove patch that removed
  db-detecting as this messed things up on amd64, even though it was marked as
  an amd64-only patch.

  19 Jul 2003; Olivier Crete <tester@gentoo.org> gnome-libs-1.4.2.ebuild,
  files/no-libdb-check.diff:

  23 Oct 2002; Spider <spider@gentoo.org> gnome-libs-1.4.2.ebuild :

  /usr/share/doc/ .
