/*
 * Overview
 *
 * A GConf back-end is a storage implementation for the GConf API. Different
 * back-ends or "drivers" are integrated into GConf using a struct
 * GConfBackendVTable containing function pointers, simulating a C++
 * virtual function pointer table (vtable).
 *
 * This back-end uses the BerkeleyDB database toolkit from Sleepycat
 * software (www.sleepycat.com). BerkeleyDB is not a relational database,
 * but is highly suited to GConf as it simply stores key-value pairs and
 * is relatively efficient.
 *
 * The storage model if implemented in a relational database would
 * use two tables:
 *
 *   Directory structure table: { directory_path, id, parent_directory_id }
 *   Keyname/Value table:       { key_name, directory_id, value }
 *
 * A keyname is the last element in the hierarchical key; a directory path
 * is required to form the complete key - this composition of directory path
 * and keyname is called a keypath.
 *
 * Because a BerkeleyDB database can only store a single key+value pair,
 * this program splits these tables into four databases:
 *
 * Table:        Key | Value:                          Data?
 * -----         -----------                           ----
 * BDB_DIR       directory_path | directory_id         Yes
 * BDB_HIERARCHY directory_id | child_directory_name   No
 * BDB_KEY       directory_id | keyname                No
 * BDB_VALUE     keypath | value                       Yes
 * BDB_SCHEMA    keypath | schema-key                  Yes
 * BDB_SCHKEY    directory_id | schema-key-name        No
 *
 * A Data table is one that may not have records with identical keys. Other
 * tables may not contain identical key-value pairs (i.e. two records
 * could have the same key but must have different values).
 *

 * Note that an important goal is that all tables could be
 * reconstructed from the BDB_VALUE table and the BDB_SCHEMA table.  This
 * is possible because the BDB_VALUE table contains the full key-name (the
 * keypath) and the value, similar to the BDB_SCHEMA table; the other
 * tables permit the database to be traversed hierarchically instead of
 * linearly.
 *
 * Locales
 * 
 * Locale data is stored in a subdirectory of the regular key directory for each
 * locale; e.g. the Spanish locale data for a key /gnome/desktop/logo is
 * /gnome/desktop/%locale%es/logo. This allows locale data to be found
 * efficiently, e.g. the all_entries() backend method accepts a list of
 * locales to be searched. If the list contains, { "es", "en", "C" }
 * then the directories searched are /gnome/desktop/, /gnome/desktop/%locale%es,
 * /gnome/desktop/%locale%en, and /gnome/desktop/%locale%C.
 *
 * Schemas
 *
 * Schemas are stored with regular keys in the BDB_VALUE database, but it
 * is necessary to search for them specifically. This requires two databases,
 * BDB_SCHEMA to store the "applyto" key (see the GConf docs) and the schema
 * key under which the schema can be found. The BDB_SCHKEY is similar to the
 * BDB_KEY database as it records the keys in each directory for which a 
 * schema value may be found.
 *
 * Locking
 *
 * GConf doesn't specify any locking functionality at the API level.
 * Currently locking is a requirement, because workgroups and ultimately
 * enterprises will require large central GConf databases to store
 * common settings and defaults for users, although these users will
 * also require separate writable stores for their personal preferences.
 * For now, no locking functionality is implemented, but later locking may
 * be required for individual key-value pairs and for hierarchies. The
 * BDB_DIR database is locked when updating the highest integer id value
 * assigned to a directory.
 *
 * Caching
 *
 * Ideally caching should be independent of any back-end, which can only
 * be achieved by layering the cache on top of the back-ends rather than
 * within each one, though this is not always practical/efficient. This
 * implementation includes minimal caching for database structure, not
 * for values. Even this caching should be above the back-ends, as it
 * is time-consuming to find a key and to decide where it should be
 * stored; if each store in GConf has a base path, then no queries are
 * needed at run-time to locate keys for read or write.
 *
 * Atomic Saving
 *
 * BerkeleyDB transactions are used to do grouped writes.
