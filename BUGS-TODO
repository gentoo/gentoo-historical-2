	[DONE -- if new linux ebuilds are used ] In the rc3 sys.tbz2 tarball, bzImage should be in /boot/boot (GRUB will look
	for it at /boot/bzImage)

[18 Nov 2000 -achim]
	
	[FIXED] The dependencies check fails if there are different version from a
	package installed

[15 Nov 2000 - drobbins]

	A configfile management system is needed

	[DONE] gimp-1.1.29 seems to have problems with perl-5.6.0-r3, some complaint about
	@INC keeps popping up on the screen.  Unmerging and remerging gimp after the
	perl upgrade seemed to solve this problem; so it's probably no biggie.

[14 Nov 2000 - drobbins]
	[DONE]	Upgrade Gentoo Linux bootdisk to use latest version of grub
	
	[IN PROGRESS - by drobbins ] Replace syslogd and klogd with multilog and gluelog and glueklog
	
	[DONE] Move daemontools and ucspi-tcp to sys-apps, 
	
	[UNASSIGNED] add supervise support to various packages
	
	[IN PROGRESS] Upgrade default kernel to 2.4.0-test10 with patches?  What does everyone think?
	
	[DONE] We need to add dump/restore to sys-apps -- but the darn thing depends on libtermcap!
		(It'll need a patch to link against ncurses instead)
	(It's been added to app-arch, which is fine)

	[DONE -- if the new linux ebuilds are used] Default kernel location should be moved from /boot/bzImage -> /boot/boot/bzImage

[13 Nov 2000 - drobbins]
	[UNASSIGNED] Upgrade fetch feature of ebuild to eliminate partial download problem.
	
	[UNASSIGNED] Perl-5.6.0-r3's tcp and udp tests fail when my iptables-based stateful firewall is up.
		Is there a safe way to skip these tests?
	
	[FIXED] Fix build-depends feature in ebuild... it uses ${ROOT} to check for build dependencies
	when it should really ignore ${ROOT}.  ${ROOT} should only be used for runtime deps.
