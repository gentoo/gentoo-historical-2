[13 Nov 2000 - drobbins]
	Upgrade fetch feature of ebuild to eliminate partial download problem.
	Perl-5.6.0-r3's tcp and udp tests fail when my iptables-based stateful firewall is up.
		Is there a safe way to skip these tests?
	Fix build-depends feature in ebuild... it uses ${ROOT} to check for build dependencies
	when it should really ignore ${ROOT}.  ${ROOT} should only be used for runtime deps.
