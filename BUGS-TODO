	The baselayout /etc/fstab shm line should be changed to:
	shm      /dev/shm        shm      defaults                0 0
	This is for >=2.4.2 kernels.  So far, the filesystem name has
	changed from swapfs->tmpfs->shm in less than three kernel releases,
	and I hope it stays the same for now.


[UNASSIGNED] blender-2.04 is linked to libMesaGLU and friends.  But, the nvidia 
	(and xfree86, I think) packages don't install libMesa compatibility symlinks.
	We need to either fix this or create a mesa-compat package.

[achim] updating package-dependencies based on sys-build as a minimum

[UNASSIGNED] Perl-5.6.0-r3's tcp and udp tests fail when my iptables-based stateful firewall is up.
Is there a safe way to skip these tests?
