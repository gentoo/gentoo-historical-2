# One of the following options must be enabled. The filename specified by
# FCGI_SOCKET will be suffixed with a number for each child process, for
# example, fcgi.socket-1. The port specified by FCGI_PORT is the port used
# by the first child process. If this is set to 1234 then subsequent child
# processes will use 1235, 1236, etc.
#
FCGI_SOCKET=
FCGI_PORT=1234

# When using FCGI_PORT, connections will only be accepted from the following
# address. The default is 127.0.0.1. Use 0.0.0.0 to bind to all addresses.
#
FCGI_ADDRESS=127.0.0.1

# The path to your FastCGI application. These sometimes carry the .fcgi
# extension but not always. For PHP, you should usually point this to
# /usr/bin/php-cgi.
#
FCGI_PROGRAM=/path/to/application.fcgi

# The number of child processes to spawn. The default is 1. For PHP
# applications, set this to 1 and use PHP_FCGI_CHILDREN instead.
#
FCGI_CHILDREN=1

# If you want to run your application inside a chroot then specify the
# directory here. Leave this blank otherwise.
#
FCGI_CHROOT=

# The user and group to run your application as. If you do not specify these,
# the application will be run as root:root.
#
FCGI_USER=
FCGI_GROUP=

# If your application requires additional environment variables, you need to
# allow them here. Only the variables specified here, plus a few others
# mentioned in the init script are passed to the application.
#
ALLOWED_ENV=""

# PHP ONLY :: These two options are specific to PHP. The first is the number
# of child processes to spawn. The second is the number of requests to be
# served by a single PHP process before it is restarted.
