*nss-ldapd-0.6.7 (04 Dec 2008)

  04 Dec 2008; Doug Goldstein <cardoe@gentoo.org> +files/nslcd.rc,
  +nss-ldapd-0.6.7.ebuild:
  add new nss-ldapd package which is a fork of nss_ldap. It simplifies the
  code base and provides a small nss library that speaks to a local daemon
  that does all the LDAP communication. Due to the way NSS works, this will
  improve interaction with user programs since less code is being loaded
  into their process space.
