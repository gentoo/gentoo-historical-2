  SExtractor (Source Extractor) is a program that builds a catalogue of
  objects from an astronomical image. Although it is particularly
  oriented towards reduction of large scale galaxy-survey data, it
  performs rather well on moderately crowded star fields. It has the
  ability to automatically separate stars and galaxy using neural
  networks.
