*mc-4.5.55-r2 (22 Mar 2002)

  22 Mar 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> mc-4.5.55-r2.ebuild :

  LFH compliance: Matthew Kennedy submitted us this fix, which places the man
  pages into the /usr/share/man tree, instead of /usr/man.  This turns out to
  be more LFH compliant, in addition to placin the manpages where man knows to
  look for them (/usr/man is not in MANPATH).

*mc-4.5.55-r1 (10 Mar 2002)

  10 Mar 2002; Bruce A. Locke <blocke@shivan.org> mc-4.5.55-r1.ebuild :
