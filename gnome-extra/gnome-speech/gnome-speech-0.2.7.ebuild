# FIXME: This package depends on bonobo-activation, which is included in
# recent versions of libbonobo. However, if one were to use slightly older
# versions of these packages, we would have to rely on
# gnome-base/bonobo-activation.

# The Java support for this package seems to be somewhat brain-damaged,
# and although it would be nice to implement it via the "java" USE flag,
# we will have to disable it entirely for now.
