*avifile-0.7.4-20020426-r2 (26 May 2002)

  26 May 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> :

  Remove the suffix added to all binaries.

  25 May 2002; Matthew Kennedy <mkennedy@gentoo.org> avifile-0.7.4-20020426-r1.ebuild
  files/digest-avifile-0.7.4-r1-20020426,
  files/avifile-0.7.4.20020426-gcc3.1-gentoo.patch :

  Fix avifile code to compile under gcc3.1. This will be an upstream
  patch also. I'm masking this until gcc-.2.95.3 users verify that it
  works for them too.

*avifile-0.7.4-20020426 (20 Apr 2002)

  30 Apr 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> avifile-0.7.4-20020426.ebuild
  files/digest-avifile-0.7.4-20020426 :

  Version bump to newest snapshot.  Upstream claims this is a bugfix release.

  avifile-0.7.3.20020419-r1.ebuild, ChangeLog,
  files/digest-avifile-0.7.3.20020419-r1 :

  Should be --without-qt instead of --disable-qt (only users without
  qt installed will see this produce a fatal error).

avifile-0.7.3.20020419 (24 Apr 2002)

  24 Apr 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> avifile-0.7.3.20020419.ebuild
  files/digest-avifile-0.7.3.20020419 :

  Version bump to newest snapshot.  This should work with the latest 
  divx4linux and now has ffmpeg compiled as default.  And they have actually
  named this thing consistent with the 0.6 series!

avifile-0.6.0.20011220-r2 (13 Apr 2002) 

  13 Apr 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org>

  Trying to make avifile more friendly towards kde3 users.  This closes bug
  #1713 -- so thanks to edwardam@interlix.com (Edward Muller) for discovering
  this.  Also, many thanks to andee in #gentoo for being the tester, and 
  woodchip for his insight.

  13 Apr 2002; M.Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> :

  After much thought, decided to remove the "avi" USE flag, as it enabling or
  disabling use of the win32 codecs is not valid.  Also, avifile's main use *is*
  to do avi.

*avifile-0.7.20020412 (12 Apr 2002)

  12 Apr 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> avifile-0.7.20020412.ebuild:

  New release, and they keep changing the naming scheme -- aaarrgh

  28 Mar 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> avifile-0.6.0-20011220-r1.ebuild :

  Many changes in here, involving USE dependent compilation of support for:
  oggvorbis, avi (win32codecs), sdl, mmx/3dnow/sse (x86 optimisation), kde
  (for kde sample somethings)

*avifile-0.6.0.20011220 (17 Feb 2002)

*avifile-0.53.5-r1 (1 Feb 2002)

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :

  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
