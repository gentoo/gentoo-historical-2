*helixplayer-1.0.1 (14 Nov 2004)

  14 Nov 2004; Chris White <chriswhite@gentoo.org>
  +files/helixplayer-1.0.1-bif.patch, +files/helixplayer-1.0.1-sem_t.patch,
  +files/helixplayer-1.0_beta1-bif.patch, +helixplayer-1.0.1.ebuild,
  helixplayer-1.0_beta1.ebuild:
  Fixed an nptl bug before it happens. Removed the gcc patch as it's fixed by
  upstream. Bumped to 1.0.1. Re-organized the patches.

  14 Jul 2004; Jeremy Huddleston <eradicator@gentoo.org>
  helixplayer-1.0_beta1.ebuild:
  -amd64 -sparc. Build fails silently on both platforms. Amd64 needs a build
  system patch, but it still fails. Sparc appears to be supported, but it fails
  to build as well.
