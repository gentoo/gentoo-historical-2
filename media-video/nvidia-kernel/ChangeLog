  16 Aug 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org>: Added the
  IGNORE_CC_MISMATCH make flag; in some cases, the NVIDIA build process tries
  to be too smart and intentionally aborts when it shouldn't. This is a
  build-related change, so no version bump (still 1.0.2960)

*nvidia-kernel-1.0.2960 (26 May 2002)

*nvidia-kernel-1.0.2880-r1 (29 Apr 2002)

  08 May 2002; Jon Nelson <jnelson@gentoo.org> nvidia-kernel-1.0.2880-r1.ebuild:
  Make sure to usr KERNDIR=/usr/src/linux /usr/src/linux should be a symlink
  pointing to the real sources, which may lie outside /usr/src.  KV is set
  appropriately in any case by more recent versions of portage.

  03 May 2002; Arcady Genkin <agenkin@thpoon.com>
  nvidia-kernel-1.0.2800-r1.ebuild: Make sure that Portage *does* set KV to
  something; bail out otherwise. ;^)
	
  29 Apr 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org>: Changed NV_KV to KV and
  added a Portage dependency to ensure that KV is available.  Should fix some
  build problems.

*nvidia-kernel-1.0.2880 (7 Apr 2002)

  7 Apr 2002; M.Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> nvidia-kernel-1.0.2880.ebuild
  Fixed all the spaces.
