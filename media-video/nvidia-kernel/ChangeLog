*nvidia-kernel-1.0.2960-r1 (16 Aug 2002)

  17 Aug 2002; Gustavo Felisberto <gustavo@felisberto.net>: Changed a small
  line in the ebuild so that the kernel module gets installed in
  /lib/modules/${KV}/video this way a "make modules_install" in /usr/src/linux
  will not erase the nvidia module. (added by drobbins) This closes bug #5572.
  
  16 Aug 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org>: set SLOT to $KV, removed
  module removal and modprobing from pkg_postinst(). The module stuff had to be
  removed because NVdriver compiles for the kernel in /usr/src/linux, not
  necessarily the currently-running kernel. It's also a violation of Gentoo
  Linux policy to automatically mess with someone's modules. SLOT being set to
  $KV allows multiple sets of NVdriver modules to be installed for differing
  kernel versions. Doesn't work 100% yet because we don't yet support differing
  SLOTs for the exact same version of a package, but will soon.
  
  16 Aug 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org>: Added the
  IGNORE_CC_MISMATCH make flag; in some cases, the NVIDIA build process tries
  to be too smart and intentionally aborts when it shouldn't. This is a
  build-related change, so no version bump (still 1.0.2960)

*nvidia-kernel-1.0.2960 (26 May 2002)

*nvidia-kernel-1.0.2880-r1 (29 Apr 2002)

  08 May 2002; Jon Nelson <jnelson@gentoo.org> nvidia-kernel-1.0.2880-r1.ebuild:
  Make sure to usr KERNDIR=/usr/src/linux /usr/src/linux should be a symlink
  pointing to the real sources, which may lie outside /usr/src.  KV is set
  appropriately in any case by more recent versions of portage.

  03 May 2002; Arcady Genkin <agenkin@thpoon.com>
  nvidia-kernel-1.0.2800-r1.ebuild: Make sure that Portage *does* set KV to
  something; bail out otherwise. ;^)
	
  29 Apr 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org>: Changed NV_KV to KV and
  added a Portage dependency to ensure that KV is available.  Should fix some
  build problems.

*nvidia-kernel-1.0.2880 (7 Apr 2002)

  7 Apr 2002; M.Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> nvidia-kernel-1.0.2880.ebuild
  Fixed all the spaces.
