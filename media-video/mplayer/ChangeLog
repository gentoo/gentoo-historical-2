*mplayer-0.60-r5 (12 Apr 2002)

  14 Apr 2002; M.Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> mplayer-0.60-r5 :

  Remove the png USE flag, as the gui depends on libpng.  Take --enable-dvdread
  out of the main ./configure part, as its now done with the dvd use flag.
  Clean the mmx and X USE flag selection parts up.

*mplayer-0.60-r4 (12 Apr 2002)

  12 Apr 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> mplayer-0.60-r4.ebuild :

  Added png USE flag and removed css USE flag for dvd flag instead. And, 
  compile against newest libpng

*mplayer-0.60-r3 (28 Mar 2002)

  28 Mar 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> mplayer-0.60-r3.ebuild :

  ogg and vorbis USE flags combined to have oggvorbis USE flag instead.

*mplayer-0.60-r3 (3 March 2002)

  3 March 2002; M.Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> mplayer-0.60-r3.ebuild :

  Add the DXR3 patch. Update the DEPEND to include libpng if gtk is in USE.

  25 Feb 2002; M.Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> mplayer-0.60-r2.ebuild :

  Fix the 'fbcon' USE to actually enable fbdev support.

  17 Feb 2002; M.Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> mplayer-0.60-r2.ebuild :

  Make DVD support default.  Changed the USE flag for DVD decription from
  'decss' to 'css'.  Added 3DFX support with the '3dfx' use variable. Fixed
  a problem where if 'sse' or '3dnow' was in USE, but now MMX, sound would be
  distorted .. this should resolve bug #536.

*mplayer-0.60-r1 (1 Feb 2002)

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
  
  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
