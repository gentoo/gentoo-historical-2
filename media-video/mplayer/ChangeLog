  17 Feb 2002; M.Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> mplayer-0.60-r2.ebuild :

  Make DVD support default.  Changed the USE flag for DVD decription from
  'decss' to 'css'.  Added 3DFX support with the '3dfx' use variable. Fixed
  a problem where if 'sse' or '3dnow' was in USE, but now MMX, sound would be
  distorted .. this should resolve bug #536.

*mplayer-0.60-r1 (1 Feb 2002)
