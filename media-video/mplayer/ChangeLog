*mplayer-0.90_pre2 (30 Apr 2002)

  26 Apr 2002; William McArthur <sandymac@gentoo.org> mplayer-0.90_pre1.ebuild :

  Commented out a matrox specific patch that seems to be aready in the upstream
  package.

*mplayer-0.90_pre1 (23 Apr 2002)

*mplayer-0.60-r6 (22 Apr 2002)

  22 Apr 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> mplayer-0.60-r6.ebuild :

  Removed directfb flag for now, until next mplayer release.  Also, added
  --disable-runtime-cpudetection for increased performance.  First one thanks
  to naz in #gentoo, second one thanks to 
  dwright@beached.dyndns.org (Darrell Wright) in bug #1967
  

  18 Apr 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org>
  fixed a small typo I made in the matrox section

  17 Apr 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> mplayer-0.60-r6.ebuild
  files/digest-mplayer-0.60-r6 :

  Removed -- the old source tarball will be mirrored on ibilio instead.

*mplayer-0.60-r6 (17 Apr 2002)

  17 Apr 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> mplayer-0.60-r6.ebuild
  files/digest-mplayer-0.60-r6 :

  This is an upgrade in a way, because it is now fetching the cvs snapshot
  from the site.  The actual 0.60 sources have been removed from the
  SRC_URI, and they are replaced with a weekly snapshot.  This is fine
  because it offers much better performance than the old "stable" version.

*mplayer-0.60-r5 (14 Apr 2002)

  14 Apr 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> mplayer-0.60-r5.ebuild :

  Cleaned up some of the USE flag checking, and made it more consistent, so
  that there are no if then fi constructs for USE flags.

*mplayer-0.60-r5 (12 Apr 2002)

  14 Apr 2002; M.Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> mplayer-0.60-r5 :

  Remove the png USE flag, as the gui depends on libpng.  Take --enable-dvdread
  out of the main ./configure part, as its now done with the dvd use flag.
  Clean the mmx and X USE flag selection parts up.

*mplayer-0.60-r4 (12 Apr 2002)

  12 Apr 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> mplayer-0.60-r4.ebuild :

  Added png USE flag and removed css USE flag for dvd flag instead. And, 
  compile against newest libpng

*mplayer-0.60-r3 (28 Mar 2002)

  28 Mar 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> mplayer-0.60-r3.ebuild :

  ogg and vorbis USE flags combined to have oggvorbis USE flag instead.

*mplayer-0.60-r3 (3 March 2002)

  3 March 2002; M.Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> mplayer-0.60-r3.ebuild :

  Add the DXR3 patch. Update the DEPEND to include libpng if gtk is in USE.

  25 Feb 2002; M.Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> mplayer-0.60-r2.ebuild :

  Fix the 'fbcon' USE to actually enable fbdev support.

  17 Feb 2002; M.Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> mplayer-0.60-r2.ebuild :

  Make DVD support default.  Changed the USE flag for DVD decription from
  'decss' to 'css'.  Added 3DFX support with the '3dfx' use variable. Fixed
  a problem where if 'sse' or '3dnow' was in USE, but now MMX, sound would be
  distorted .. this should resolve bug #536.

*mplayer-0.60-r1 (1 Feb 2002)

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
  
  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
