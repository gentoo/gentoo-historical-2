  Fix the 'fbcon' USE to actually enable fbdev support.

  17 Feb 2002; M.Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> mplayer-0.60-r2.ebuild :

  Make DVD support default.  Changed the USE flag for DVD decription from
  'decss' to 'css'.  Added 3DFX support with the '3dfx' use variable. Fixed
  a problem where if 'sse' or '3dnow' was in USE, but now MMX, sound would be
  distorted .. this should resolve bug #536.

  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
