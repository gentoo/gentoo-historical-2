*xine-ui-0.9.10-r1 (16 Jun 2002)

  16 Jun 2002; Brandon Low <lostlogic@gentoo.org> xine-ui-0.9.10-r1.ebuild

  Added gcc-3.1 support, ensure that DirectFB really gets diabled, again,
  gcc-3.1 users will not be able to use DirectFB.

*xine-ui-0.9.9-r2 (16 Jun 2002)

  16 Jun 2002; Brandon Low <lostlogic@gentoo.org> xine-ui-0.9.9-r2.ebuild

  Turn off directfb for real if it isn't in use, and also patch this
  punk a little bit so that it works with gcc-3.1 (LDFLAGS issue)

  gcc-3.1 users at this time will not be able to use directfb with xine, 
  hopefully this will be resolved in the near future...

*xine-ui-0.9.9-r1 (31 May 2002)

  31 May 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org>
  xine-ui-gentoo-extra.tar.bz2 (distfiles) :

  Updated the directfb stuff from xine's cvs, so it will now compile with
  DirectFB-0.9.10

*xine-ui-0.9.10 (26 May 2002)

  26 May 2002; Arcady Genkin <agenkin@thpoon.com> xine-ui-0.9.10.ebuld :

  Update to version 0.9.10.

*xine-ui-0.9.9-r1 (1 May 2002)

  1 May 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> xine-ui-0.9.9-r1.ebuild
  files/digest-xine-ui-0.9.9-r1 xine-ui-gentoo-extra.tar.bz2 (distfiles) :

  For some reason, upstream forgot to package all the necessary files for
  DirectFB support.  This would have been one thing if we could have 
  configured to disable that support, but DirectFB is autodetected.  So, the
  tarball on the ibiblio mirror contains those files as grabbed from xine-ui's
  cvs repository (where they have not been altered in months).

*xine-ui-0.9.9 (29 Apr 2002)

*xine-ui-0.9.7-r3 (12 Apr 2002)

  12 Apr 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> xine-ui-0.9.7-r3.ebuild :
  
  Compile against latest libpng


*xine-ui-0.9.7-r2 (12 Mar 2002)
  
  12 Mar 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
	
  Added checking of nls in USE toggles.  Also added checking of gnome in 
  USE toggles to have xine-ui use ORBit.  However, I had initially done
  use gnome || enable ORBit instead of &&.  Found it thanks to supox.
  OK no this still does not work.  ORBit support in xine seems questionable, at
  best.  I am commenting that stuff out in the ebuild until I can find some
  answers about it.

  19 Feb 2002; M.Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> xine-ui-0.9.8-r1.ebuild :

  Fix docs not installing in /usr/share/doc/${PF}.

*xine-ui-0.9.7 (1 Feb 2002)

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
  
  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
