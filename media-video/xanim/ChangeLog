  02 Mar 2004; <agriffis@gentoo.org> xanim-2.80.1-r4.ebuild:
  Do a cleanup of the arch support in this ebuild so that ia64 can build. These
  changes obviate files/Makefile and files/Makefile.amd64 and might even allow
  hppa and mips to build without changes to the ebuild. I don't think I broke
  anything

  mark stable on amd64

  04 Oct 2003; Brad House <brad_mssw@gentoo.org> xanim-2.80.1-r4.ebuild:

  28 Sep 2003; Markus Nigbur <pyrania@gentoo.org> xanim-2.80.1-r4.ebuild,

  04 Dec 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> xanim-2.80.1-r4.ebuild :

  Fixed the DEPEND syntax.  The case $ARCH stuff for adding ncompress to the
  DEPEND list was not working.  Thanks to [DJ]Hack in #gentoo-sparc for
  pointing out the failure.
