*mjpegtools-1.6.0-r7 (27 Dec 2002)

  27 Dec 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> mjpegtools-1.6.0-r7.ebuild :
  Moved elibtoolize to src_compile.  Remove the unneeded 'if then fi' 's for
  the 'mmx' 'sse' and '3dnow' USE flags in [R]DEPEND, as they are already
  in [R]DEPEND ...

*mjpegtools-1.6.0-r6 (03 Dec 2002)

  03 Dec 2002; Jon Nall <nall@gentoo.org> mjpegtools-1.6.0-r6.ebuild :
  I didn't create this version. there was no ChangeLog entry for -r6
  (though i think phoen][x's comment from 25 Nov 2002 refers to -r6.)
  
  I added ~ppc and made libmovtar mmx-dependent

*mjpegtools-1.6.0-r5 (d1814 Nov 2002)

  25 Nov 2002; phoen][x <phoenix@gentoo.org>  mjpegtools-1.6.0-r5 :
  Fixed a really evil bug which caused mjpegtools to fail in lavtools/
  when merged with USE="quicktime" - the problem comes down to this:
  lav_common.c and lav_io.c both use "dv_decoder_new(0,0,0);" which is
  wrong because dv_decoder_new() doesn't take any arguments. I used sed
  to work around that - it should work flawlessy now. This fixes bug #11163.

  14 Nov 2002; Matthew Kennedy <mkennedy@gentoo.org>

  mjpegtools-1.6.0-r4.ebuild files/digest-mjpegtools-1.6.0-r4 :
