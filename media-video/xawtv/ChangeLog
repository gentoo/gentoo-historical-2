*xawtv-3.80 (12 Dec 2002)

  12 Dec 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> xawtv-3.80.ebuild
  files/digest-xawtv-3.80 :

  Version bump, thanks to: jordanmeek@yahoo.com (Jordan Meek) in bug #11143.
  Also, this solves the issue with 3.78, where the fonts would screw up X
  completely, closing bug #10238 by googleplex@wi.rr.com (Dave Berenson)

  Later, same day: some small fixes for fonts again.

*xawtv-3.78 (04 Nov 2002)

  files/tv-fonts-1.0-gentoo.diff files/digest-xawtv-3.78 files/webcamrc :

  Version bump.  This release depends on libquicktime instead and the fonts
  package is downloaded separately.  Thanks to: jmarcet@pobox.com (Javier
  Marcet) in bug #7345 for informing us.  Also provided a default webcamrc
  in the docs directory.  Thanks to: sascha@killerhippy.de (Sascha
  Wuestemann) in bug #9895 for that.  Thanks to kev@kvance.com (Kev Vance)
  in bug #7651 for the libquicktime heads up.

  30 Mar 2002; Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org> xawtv-3.65-r1.ebuild :

  Added "use alsa" and corrected installation of fonts.  Now the font
  installation doesn't violate the sandbox, and mkfontdir is properly run
  after merge/unmerge.

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :

  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that
  the comments should well explained and written in clean English. The
  details about writing correct changelogs are explained in the
  skel.ChangeLog file which you can find in the root directory of the
  portage repository.
