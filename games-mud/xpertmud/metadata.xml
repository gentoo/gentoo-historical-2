Xpertmud is an extensible perl and python scriptable MUD client. It is based on Qt and 
KDE. There's a native Linux/KDE version as well as a native Windows/Win32 build. This 
enables you to use the same script on your Linux box at home and on your Windows box at 
work...

It supports multiple windows (which are scriptable), and you can use triggers, aliases or 
whatever you want on every bit of text that comes from or goes to the server. There's a 
stable and intuitive plugin API, so you can extend the client with Qt-based C++ code. A 
sample plugin for the btech MUX is included.
