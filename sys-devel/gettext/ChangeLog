*gettext-0.11.5-r1 (24 Nov 2002)

  24 Nov 2002; L. Boshell <leonardop@gentoo.org> : Don't delete the entire
  ${D}/usr/lib directory, only the files that could be problematic (i.e.
  *.{a,so}. Added IUSE var. Use mirror://gnu for SRC_URI.
  
  11 Sep 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> gettext-0.11.1.ebuild :

  Make sure that no headers is installed.  Seems like this happened in
  very rare instances, bug #7682.

*gettext-0.11.5 (16 Aug 2002)

  16 Aug 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> gettext-0.11.5.ebuild
  files/digest-gettext-0.11.5 :

  Version bump.

*gettext-0.11.3-r1 (3 Aug 2002)

  3 Aug 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> gettext-0.11.3-r1.ebuild :

  Remove the installed header files, as these overwrite those that comes with
  glibc, and then breaks things.

*gettext-0.11.3 (21 Jul 2002)

  21 Jul 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> gettext-0.11.3.ebuild :
  files/digest-gettext-0.11.3 :

  Version bump.

  17 Apr 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> gettext-0.11.1-r1.ebuild :

  Vitaly reports that glibc doesn't have libs, but contains the functioality
  of the gettext libs.  this ebuild is unnecessary.

*gettext-0.11.1-r1 (16 Apr 2002)

  16 Apr 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> gettext-0.11.1-r1.ebuild
  files/digest-gettext-0.11.1-r1 :

  Since glibc does not seem to be providing the header files and such, I have
  enabled gettext to install them instead.  Hopefully this solves the
  intermittent php emerge bug.

*gettext-0.11.1

  27 Mar 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> gettext-0.11.1.ebuild :

  Version bump -- copied old ebuild to new name.

*gettext-0.10.40 (1 Feb 2002)

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
  
  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
