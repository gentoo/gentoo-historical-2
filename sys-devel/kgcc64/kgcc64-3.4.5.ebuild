			# This is a very special patch -- it allows us to build semi-usable kernels
			# on SGI IP28 (Indigo2 Impact R10000) systems.  The patch is henceforth
			# regarded as a kludge by upstream, and thus, it will never get accepted upstream,
			# but for our purposes of building a kernel, it works.
			# Unless you're building an IP28 kernel, you really don't need care about what
			# this patch does, because if you are, you are probably already aware of what
			# it does.
			# All that said, the abilities of this patch are disabled by default and need
			# to be enabled by passing -mip28-cache-barrier.  Only used to build kernels, 
			# There is the possibility it may be used for very specific userland apps too.
