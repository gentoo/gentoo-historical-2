*gcc-3.0.4-r5 (2 May 2002)

  2 May 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> gcc-3.0.4-r5 :

  Only move .la files for parallel builds, else some packages (KDE *grin*)
  fails to build.

*gcc-2.95.3-r6 (30 Apr 2002)

  30 Apr 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org>: removed libiberty.a as
  binutils installs it.  This closes bug #2266.

*gcc-3.0.4-r4 (25 Apr 2002)

  25 Apr 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> gcc-3.0.4-r4 :

  Only apply the gcc3-program-transform.patch patch if building 
  a multiple install of gcc.

  17 Apr 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> gcc-3.0.4-r3 :

  Move .la files to gcc internal dir to fix gcc2+libtool problems
  of trying to link /usr/lib/libstdc++.so.

*gcc-3.0.4-r3 (16 Apr 2002)

  16 Apr 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> :

  Moved the manpages to version spesific ones.  More cleanups.
  Moved libgcj.jar to /usr/lib/gcc-$PV.

*gcc-3.0.4-r2 (15 Apr 2002)

  15 Apr 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> :

  This build enables us to have multiple versions of gcc
  installed.

*gcc-3.0.4 (1 Mar 2002)

  1 Mar 2002; Grant Goodyear <g2boojum@gentoo.org> :

  Added 3.0.4.  It looks like using the --disable-checks
  command fixes most of the sandbox violations that we had
  with 3.0.3 (or 3.0.4 no longer tries to update system
  headers; I'm not sure which).
  
*gcc-2.95.3-r5 (1 Feb 2002)

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
  
  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
