*gcc-3.0.4 (1 Mar 2002)

  1 Mar 2002; Grant Goodyear <g2boojum@gentoo.org> :

  Added 3.0.4.  It looks like using the --disable-checks
  command fixes most of the sandbox violations that we had
  with 3.0.3 (or 3.0.4 no longer tries to update system
  headers; I'm not sure which).
  
*gcc-2.95.3-r5 (1 Feb 2002)

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
  
  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
