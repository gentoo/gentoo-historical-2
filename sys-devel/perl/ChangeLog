  files/digest-perl-5.6.1-r4 :

  Added an eclass called perl-post.eclass, which this ebuild now inherits,

  emerging and unmerging.

  HTML documentation no longer gets gzipped, but a revision upgrade wasn't
  absolutely necessary, I don't think.  Thanks to stefan@mdy.univie.ac.at
  for pointing it out.

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
  
  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
