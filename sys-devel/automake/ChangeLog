automake-1.6.1 (19 May 2002)

  19 May 2002; M.Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> automake-1.6.1.ebuild,
                                               am-wrapper.pl-1.6 :

  New version.  Thanks to Alexander Kelett for the initial version that
  contains all three major releases, and also am-wrapper.pl-1.6.

  Changes from his version:  1.5d has to have "-1.5d" as suffix, and
  not "-1.5", as this causes calls by aclocal to automake to fail,
  as they have multiversion support.  Also fixed some other problems
  that was part of my first dual version.  Added the sed to change
  the "-1.5x" in am-wrapper.pl-1.6 to "-1.5d".

  Anyway, should resolve bug 2803.

  22 April 2002; M.Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> am-wrapper.pl :

  Update so that it can work with AC_PREREQ([2.13]) as well as AC_PREREQ(2.13).
	
automake-1.5d-r2 (21 March 2002)

  7 April 2002; M.Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> :

  Change the names of the 1.5x binaries to foo-${PV}, since they do support
  limited parallel versions, and foo-1.5x breaks recursion if they call
  themselfs.  Fixed doc paths.

*automake-1.6-r1 (21 March 2002)

  21 March 2002; M.Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> :

  Create dual ebuild for automake-1.4x and automake-1.6x.  Have the
  same autodetection as autoconf-1.53, check am-wrapper.pl for details.

*automake-1.6 (21 March 2002)

*automake-1.4_p5 (1 Feb 2002)

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :

  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
