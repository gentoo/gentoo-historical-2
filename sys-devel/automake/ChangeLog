*automake-1.6.3 (20 Oct 2002)

  20 Oct 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> :
  Update version.

  23 Sep 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> am-wrapper.pl-1.6 :
  Firstly, 'am-wrapper.pl' is based on 'ac-wrapper.pl'.  This is a nifty
  script by Guillaume Cottenceau (gc@mandrakesoft.com).  This release
  adds updates for automake-1.6 detection.

*automake-1.6.1-r6 (28 Jun 2002)

  28 Jun 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> automake-1.6.1-r6.ebuild :
  Patch aclocal-1.4 to behave like 1.5 and 1.6, and not error our on duplicates.
  This should fix bug #4157 and others.

*automake-1.6.1-r5 (21 Jun 2002)

  21 Jun 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> automake-1.6.1-r5.ebuild :
  Resolve bug #3985.

*automake-1.6.1-r4 (22 May 2002)

  22 May 2002; M.Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> automake-1.6.1-r4.ebuild :

  Remove duplicate macros in /usr/share/aclocal/ (old stale ones that is
  now in /usr/share/aclocal-1.4/.

*automake-1.6.1-r3 (22 May 2002)

  22 May 2002; M.Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> automake-1.6.1-r3.ebuild :

  Create /usr/share/automake as symlink to /usr/share/automake-1.4, as
  some packages needs it.  Resolves bug #2903.

*automake-1.6.1-r2 (20 May 2002)

  20 May 2002; M.Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> automake-1.6.1-r2.ebuild :

  Seems aclocal-1.6 already searched /usr/share/aclocal-1.6/ and
  /usr/share/aclocal/ by default, so no need to fix it like we have to
  for 1.5 and 1.4.

*automake-1.6.1-r1 (19 May 2002)

  19 May 2002; M.Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> automake-1.6.1-r1.ebuild :

  Use automake-1.5 instead of automake-1.5d to try and fix KDE.

  Another big change, is that we now have all the macros (.m4 files) for
  each version of automake in their own private dirs, but then add
  /usr/share/aclocal/ to each version's aclocal's include path.  This
  makes it possible for each version to use custom macros added by
  other programs to /usr/share/aclocal/.

*automake-1.6.1 (19 May 2002)

  19 May 2002; M.Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> automake-1.6.1.ebuild,
                                               am-wrapper.pl-1.6 :

  New version.  Thanks to Alexander Kelett for the initial version that
  contains all three major releases, and also am-wrapper.pl-1.6.

  Changes from his version:  1.5d has to have "-1.5d" as suffix, and
  not "-1.5", as this causes calls by aclocal to automake to fail,
  as they have multiversion support.  Also fixed some other problems
  that was part of my first dual version.  Added the sed to change
  the "-1.5x" in am-wrapper.pl-1.6 to "-1.5d".

  Anyway, should resolve bug 2803.

  22 April 2002; M.Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> am-wrapper.pl :

  Update so that it can work with AC_PREREQ([2.13]) as well as AC_PREREQ(2.13).
	
*automake-1.5d-r2 (21 March 2002)

  7 April 2002; M.Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> :

  Change the names of the 1.5x binaries to foo-${PV}, since they do support
  limited parallel versions, and foo-1.5x breaks recursion if they call
  themselfs.  Fixed doc paths.

*automake-1.6-r1 (21 March 2002)

  21 March 2002; M.Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> :

  Create dual ebuild for automake-1.4x and automake-1.6x.  Have the
  same autodetection as autoconf-1.53, check am-wrapper.pl for details.

*automake-1.6 (21 March 2002)

*automake-1.4_p5 (1 Feb 2002)

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
  
  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
