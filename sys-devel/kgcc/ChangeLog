*kgcc-2.95.3 (31 Dec 2002)

  09 Jan 2003; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> :

  KEYWORDED for only sparc, as that is the only architecture which needs it,
  even though it can work for others (for future references).

  31 Dec 2002; Stefan Jones <Cretin@gentoo.org> :
  Installs a gcc-2.95.3 C-compiler only, named kgcc, used to compile sparc
  32bit kernels.
