*libperl-5.8.0 (06 Jan 2003)

  08 Jan 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> libperl-5.8.0.ebuild :

  Unmasked for sparc

  08 Jan 2003; Michael Cummings <mcummings@gentoo.org> libperl-5.8.0:
  Unmasking for x86.

  06 Jan 2003; Michael Cummings <mcummings@gentoo.org> libperl-5.8.0:
  Initial import. Ebuild was provided by azarah. The seperation of
  the libperl portion of perl into a seperate ebuild is to counter 
  problems experienced with migrating perl versions and the need to 
  recompile libperl.so at each run. This should also allow us a smoother
  upgrade with future perl releases as the libperl.so is no named
  according to perl versions - that way, old libperl's can co-exist
  with new ones and the need to recompile packages should be 
  mitigated.
