autoconf-1.52d-r1 (21 March 2002)

7 April 2002; M.Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> :

  Change the names of the 2.5x binaries to foo-${PV}, since they do support
  limited parallel versions, and foo-2.5x breaks recursion if they call
  themselfs.  Fixed doc paths.

*autoconf-2.53 (21 March 2002)

  21 March 2002; M.Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> :

  Add dual ebuild which contain 2.13 and 2.53, and autodetect the
  correct version to use.

*autoconf-2.13-r2 (1 Feb 2002)

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
  
  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
