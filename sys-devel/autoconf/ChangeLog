autoconf-2.53a (22 May 2002)

  22 May 2002; M.Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> autoconf-2.53a.ebuild :

  Update in hope of fixing the gcc3 build problem (somewhere with
  m4 version detection, bug #2929.  I am not sure, as I could not
  get feedback if working or not.

autoconf-2.53-r1 (19 May 2002)

  19 May 2002; M.Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> autoconf-2.53-r1.ebuild :

  Fix it to use "-$PV" as suffix, and not "-2.5x".

  22 April 2002; M.Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> ac-wrapper.pl :

  Update so that it can work with AC_PREREQ([2.13]) as well as AC_PREREQ(2.13).

autoconf-2.52d-r1 (21 March 2002)

  7 April 2002; M.Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> :

  Change the names of the 2.5x binaries to foo-${PV}, since they do support
  limited parallel versions, and foo-2.5x breaks recursion if they call
  themselfs.  Fixed doc paths.

*autoconf-2.53 (21 March 2002)

  21 March 2002; M.Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> :

  Add dual ebuild which contain 2.13 and 2.53, and autodetect the
  correct version to use.

*autoconf-2.13-r2 (1 Feb 2002)
