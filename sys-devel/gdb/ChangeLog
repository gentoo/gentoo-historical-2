  GDB, the GNU Project debugger, allows you to see what is going on `inside'
  another program while it executes -- or what another program was doing at 
  the moment it crashed.

  GDB can do four main kinds of things (plus other things in support of these)
  to help you catch bugs in the act:

    * Start your program, specifying anything that might affect its behavior.
    * Make your program stop on specified conditions.
    * Examine what has happened, when your program has stopped.
    * Change things in your program, so you can experiment with correcting the effects of one bug and go on to learn about another.

  GDB works on a wide variety of UNIX and non-UNIX systems.

*gdb-5.0-r2 (1 Feb 2002)

  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
