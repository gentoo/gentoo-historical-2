*bison-1.34-r1 (2 Apr 2002)

  2 Apr 2002; M.Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> :

  Change "make install" in src_install() to use $DESTDIR and not
  $prefix, as some packages have the nasty habit of hardcoding
  $prefix in "make install".  Hopefully this will fix an invalid
  search patch for bison.{hairy,simple} some users experienced
  (${D}/usr/...).

*bison-1.28-r3 (1 Feb 2002)

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
  
  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
