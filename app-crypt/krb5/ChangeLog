*krb5-1.2.5-r1 (22 Jun 2002)

  22 Jun 2002; William McArthur <sandymac@gentoo.org> :

  Changed --localstatedir from /var/krb5kdc to /var because the /krb5kdc is
  automatically appended.

*krb5-1.2.3 (21 Feb 2002)

  21 Feb 2002; Grant Goodyear <g2boojum@gentoo.org> :

  Updated to 1.2.3.

*krb5-1.2.2-r1 (21 Feb 2002)

  21 Feb 2002; Grant Goodyear <g2boojum@gentoo.org> :

  Thanks to Michael Kaufman, we now have a working ebuild.  Previous ebuild
  failed to build klist, kvno, kpasswd, kinit, and kdestroy.  There was
  also a linker problem which has been fixed.
