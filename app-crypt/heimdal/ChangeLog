  06 Dec 2002; Kain X <kain@kain.org> heimdal-0.5.1-r1.ebuild :
  Initial setup for new virtual/krb5 structure.  Shared libraries are also now
  built, but krb4 is not linked in in this case.  If you really want krb4, you
  can say USE="krb4" emerge heimdal.  This will be improved in later releases.
