  <longdescription>Modified versions of kinit that can use srvtabs or
  keytabs to authenticate, can run as daemons and wake up periodically
  to refresh a ticket, and can run single commands with their own
  authentication credentials and refresh those credentials until the
  command exits.</longdescription>
