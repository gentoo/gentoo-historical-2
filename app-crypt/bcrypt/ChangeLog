*bcrypt-1.1 (18 Jun 2003)

  18 Jun 2003; Dylan Carlson <absinthe@gentoo.org> bcrypt-1.1.ebuild:
  Initial import.

  NOTE:
  In addition to encrypting your data, bcrypt will by default overwrite the 
  original input file with random garbage three times before deleting it in 
  order to thwart data recovery attempts by persons who may gain access to 
  your computer. 
  
  If you're not quite ready for this level of paranoia yet, use the '-r'
  switch.  Please see the bcrypt(1) man page for more details.
