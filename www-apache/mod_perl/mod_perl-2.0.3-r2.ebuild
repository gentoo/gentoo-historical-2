	# I am not entirely happy with this solution, but here's what's
	# going on here if someone wants to take a stab at another
	# approach.  When userpriv compilation is off, then the make
	# process drops to user "nobody" to run the test servers.  This
	# server is closed, and then the socket is rebound using
	# SO_REUSEADDR.  If the same user does this, there is no problem,
	# and the socket may be rebound immediately.  If a different user
	# (yes, in my testing, even root) attempts to rebind, it fails.
	# Since the "is the socket available yet" code and the
	# second-batch bind call both run as root, this will fail.

	# The upstream settings on my test machine cause the second batch
	# of tests to fail, believing the socket to still be in use.  I
	# tried patching various parts to make them run as the user
	# specified in $config->{vars}{user} using getpwnam, but found
	# this patch to be fairly intrusive, because the userid must be
	# restored and the patch must be applied to multiple places.

	# For now, we will simply extend the timeout in hopes that in the
	# non-userpriv case, the socket will clear from the kernel tables
	# normally, and the tests will proceed.

	# If anybody is still having problems, then commenting out "make
	# test" below should allow the software to build properly.
