# The maximum number of seconds that a Ruby on Rails application instance may
# be idle. That is, if an application instance hasn't done anything after the
# given number of seconds, then it will be shutdown in order to conserve
# memory.

# When the RailsUserSwitching option is enabled a Rails application is started

# launch the corresponding Rails application as joe as well.
RailsUserSwitching On

# Under no circumstances will Rails applications be run as root. If
# environment.rb is owned by root or by an unknown user, then the Rails
# application will run as the user specified by RailsDefaultUser.
