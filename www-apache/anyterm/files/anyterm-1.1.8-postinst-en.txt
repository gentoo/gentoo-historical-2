DEFAULT GENTOO INSTALLATION

The default Gentoo installation is designed to work and be as secure as
possible out-of-the box as long as you have USE="ssl pam -opera".


USE FLAGS

+ssl	forces anyterm to only run over secure (HTTPS) connections.
-ssl    disables secure connections, all data will pass over the network in
        plain text, including passwords!
+pam    enables PAM authentication, so anyone with an account on your computer
        can use anyterm without any further configuration.
-pam    means that you will have to configure your own authentication
        mechanism.
+opera  Enables a workaround for a bug in the Opera browser, but you will have
        to modify apache's logging behaviour to prevent snooping by local
	users.
-opera  Disables the Opera bug workaround.


INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

1. Add the following flags to APACHE2_OPTS in /etc/init.d/apache2:
	-D ANYTERM
	-D SSL                # if USE=ssl
	-D SSL_DEFAULT_VHOST  # if USE="ssl -vhosts"
	-D AUTH_PAM           # if USE=pam

2. If you have USE=vhosts then you need to add the following directives to
   each virtual host's configuration file:
   	<Directory "${MY_INSTALLDIR}">
	  AllowOverride All
	</Directory>

3. If you have USE=opera then you should disable logging of some requests. In
   each apache configuration file add env=!DONTLOG to each CustomLog
   directive. For example:
   USE="ssl -vhosts":
   	Edit /etc/apache2/modules.d/41_mod_ssl.default-vhost.conf:
	    CustomLog logs/ssl_request_log \
	              "%t %h %{SSL_PROTOCOL}x %{SSL_CIPHER}x \"%r\" %b" \
		      env=!DONTLOG
   USE="-ssl -vhosts":
   	Edit /etc/apache2/httpd.conf:
	     CustomLog logs/access_log common env=!DONTLOG

4. Restart apache2:
	/etc/init.d/apache2 restart

5. Browse to:
	https://${VHOST_HOSTNAME}${VHOST_APPDIR}/${PN}.html  # if USE=ssl
	http://${VHOST_HOSTNAME}${VHOST_APPDIR}/${PN}.html   # if USE=-ssl
