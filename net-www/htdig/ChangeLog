  Don't run rundig from pkg_postinst(). What this did was index the whole

  Version bump. This puts the config files properly, etc etc. Needs heavy 
  testing, though.

  9 Mar 2002; Dan Armak <danarmak@gentoo.org> changelog:
  
  It seems the patchfiles downloaded from the geocities site don't have a constant MD5.
  I've put a copy on ibiblio/gentoo and the ebuild now fetches from there.

  7 Mar 2002; Dan Armak <danarmak@gentoo.org> Changelog:
  
  Added patches to make htdig work with kdevelop. This si only a temporary remedy and

  This closes bug #946.

  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is

  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
