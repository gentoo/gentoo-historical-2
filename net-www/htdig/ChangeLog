  9 Mar 2002; Dan Armak <danarmak@gentoo.org> changelog:
  
  It seems the patchfiles downloaded from the geocities site don't have a constant MD5.
  I've put a copy on ibiblio/gentoo and the ebuild now fetches from there.

*htdig-3.1.5-r2 (7 Mar 2002)

  7 Mar 2002; Dan Armak <danarmak@gentoo.org> Changelog:
  
  Added patches to make htdig work with kdevelop. This si only a temporary remedy and 
  a big overhaul of the ebuild will come as soon as there's a new maintainer (not me!).
  This closes bug #946.

*htdig-3.1.5-r1 (1 Feb 2002)

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
  
  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
