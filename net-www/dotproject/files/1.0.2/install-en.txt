To complete your installation ...
=================================

1. Create a new database for dotproject in mysql:

	mysql> CREATE DATABASE dotproject;
	mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON dotproject.*
	       TO dotproject@localhost IDENTIFIED BY
	       "yourpassword" WITH GRANT OPTION

2. Edit the configuration file

	${MY_INSTALLDIR}/includes/config.php

   You need to set 'dbuser' and 'dbpass' for sure. You will probably want
   to edit 'company_name', 'page_title', 'base_url' and 'site_domain' too.

2. Run the script:

	bash$ mysql dotproject < ${MY_SQLSCRIPTSDIR}/mysql/${PVR}_create.sql

3. Point your web browser at:

	http://${VHOST_HOSTNAME}/${MY_INSTALLDIR}/

   You should see a login page.

   Username: admin
   Password: passwd

4. Once you're in, change the admin password as soon as possible!
