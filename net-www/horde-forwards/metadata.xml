Forwards is a Horde module for setting user e-mail forwards with support 
for several popular mailers. While it has been released and is in 
production use at many sites, it is also still under development in an 
effort to expand and improve the module.

Right now, Forwards provides fairly complete support for setting 
.forward style forwards on sendmail or courier mail based systems via an 
FTP transport. It now also supports for mdaemon, and qmail and exim sql 
based systems.
