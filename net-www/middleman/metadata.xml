Middleman is a robust proxy server with many features designed to
remove unwanted content, increase privacy, and to simply make surfing
the Web a more pleasant experience. Some of the highlights include
banner and popup blocking, HTTP and FTP content caching, NTLM and
Basic authentication when forwarding through another proxy server,
regular expression substitution in downloaded files and HTTP headers,
regular expression substitution on requested URLs, many URL commands
to temporarily change the proxy settings or to view information about
a requested file, complete support for HTTP/1.1 including persistent
connections and gzip encoding, and an intutive Web interface for
configuring the proxy.
