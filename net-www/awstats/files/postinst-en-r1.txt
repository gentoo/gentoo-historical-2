# INSTRUCTIONS:
#
# If you would like to require authentication to access AWStats, then use ONE
# of the example configurations below. There are many other modules and
# options for authentication which will not be discussed here.
#
# NOTE: Related AWStats configuration directives are:
#
# AllowAccessFromWebToAuthenticatedUsersOnly=1
# AllowAccessFromWebToFollowingAuthenticatedUsers="user1 [user2 ...]"
#
# You can use these to set a per-domain user access when needed for virtual
# hosting. That means: only the selected user(s) will have access to stats for
# the particular domain. All other users will not be allowed to see the domain
# stats even though they have authenticated successfully.
###

###
# SECTION I - Basic Authentication
#
# The following example requires mod_auth (apache 2.0) or mod_auth_basic
# (apache 2.2) to work. Make sure you have installed and enabled it in
# /etc/apache2/httpd.conf
#
# Add your AWStats users to /etc/awstats/.htpasswd file.
# Please see 'man htpasswd2' for more details if you need.
#
# htpasswd2 -c /etc/awstats/.htpasswd username1 htpasswd2
# /etc/awstats/.htpasswd username2 etc...
###

#<Location "/cgi-bin/awstats.pl">
#    AuthType Basic
#    AuthName "AWStats authenticated zone"
#    AuthUserFile /etc/awstats/.htpasswd
#    Require valid-user
#</Location>

###
# SECTION II - Digest Authentication
#
# The following example requires mod_auth_digest to work.  Make sure you have
# installed and enabled it in /etc/apache2/httpd.conf
#
# Do not forget to replace www.example.com as appropriate. You can also add as
# many domains as you need to this line.
#
# Add your AWStats users to /etc/awstats/.htdigest file. Please see 'man
# htdigest2' and http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/mod/mod_auth_digest.html for
# more details if you need.
#
# htdigest2 -c /etc/awstats/.htdigest "AWStats authenticated zone" username1
# htdigest2 /etc/awstats/.htdigest "AWStats authenticated zone" username2
# etc...
