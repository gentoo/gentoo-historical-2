#taken from the README file.


#<Virtualhost www.geek.com>
#        LayoutFooter /footer.html
#        LayoutHeader /header.html
#</virtualhost>
#
#The LayoutFooter directive can also be a cgi
#(aka putting in "LayoutFooter /cgi-bin/printenv" would
#happily append the environmental variables to
#the end of all of the output for your site.
#
#If you want to cut down on processing the
#following will also work:
#<Virtualhost www.geek.com>
#        LayoutFooter "<P> This is the tail end of things<P>"
#        LayoutHeader "<P> This is the beginning of things<P>"
#</virtualhost>
#
#The following is an example which will wrap PHP along
#with html documents.
#<Virtualhost www.geek.com>
#        LayoutFooter /footer.html
#        LayoutHeader "<P> This is the beginning of things<P>"
