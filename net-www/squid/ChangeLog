*squid-2.5.1 (07 Nov 2002)

  07 Sep 2002; Donny Davies <woodchip@gentoo.org> : Chase latest release.
  Major patch cleanup.  Added USE ssl and sasl support.  Fixed KEYWORDS.
  Big authentication and helper modules reorganization.  Make dealing with
  the lame archive versioning scheme easier.  Some general cleanups.

  15 Sep 2002; Maik Schreiber <blizzy@gentoo.org> files/squid.rc6 : Removed
  hard dependency on /var/cache/squid.

*squid-2.4.7 (12 Jul 2002)

  4 May 2002; Donny Davies <woodchip@gentoo.org> : Added LICENSE, SLOT, $Headers,
  pam_stack aware pam.d/ file.

*squid-2.4.6 (20 Mar 2002)

  20 Mar 2002; Donny Davies <woodchip@gentoo.org> :  Be sure to upgrade! This
  version fixes some security glitches in older squids! Updated to latest available
  release; fixed permissions on /usr/lib/squid/*_auth programs, made the initscript
  stop() function more robust, grabbed Debian's latest patch which includes tweaking
  SQUID_MAXFD (works this time ;) plus other fixes. We now install the error pages
  for all available languages, defaulting to English. Simply change the errors symlink
  in /etc/squid to whichever you prefer. Changed the cache location to /var/cache/squid;
  sorry if this bothers anybody but it fits better here and matches /etc/passwd
  properly now. If you're upgrading you could make /var/cache/squid a symlink to
  /var/spool/squid, or move the subdirectories manually.  Heads up :)
  Changed some ./configure options; enabled cache-digests, disabled the pinger
  and added two more auth-modules. Added ability to compile without debugging.
  Removed the stale config file and the old rc5 initscript. Also removed the older
  ebuilds; they had numerous bugs. Added a pam_stack aware pam config, for future
  deployment.

  8 Feb 2002; Donny Davies <woodchip@gentoo.org> files/squid.rc6 :
  Squid can often take a long time to shutdown. Tried to make things a little more
  friendly in that situation.
