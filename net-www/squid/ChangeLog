  Be sure to upgrade! This version fixes some security glitches in older squids!

  Updated to latest available release; fixed permissions on /usr/lib/squid/*_auth
  programs, made the initscript stop() function more robust, grabbed Debian's latest
  patch which includes tweaking SQUID_MAXFD (works this time ;) plus other fixes.
  We now install the error pages for all available languages, defaulting to English.
  Simply change the errors symlink in /etc/squid to whichever you prefer. Changed
  the cache location to /var/cache/squid; sorry if this bothers anybody but it fits
  better here and matches /etc/passwd properly now. If you're upgrading you could
  make /var/cache/squid a symlink to /var/spool/squid, or move the subdirectories
  manually. Heads up :)

  Changed some ./configure options; enabled cache-digests, disabled the pinger
  and added two more auth-modules. Added ability to compile without debugging.
  Removed the stale config file and the old rc5 initscript. Also removed the older
  ebuilds; they had numerous bugs. Added a pam_stack aware pam config, for future
  deployment.

  8 Feb 2002; Donny Davies <woodchip@gentoo.org> files/squid.rc6 :

  Squid can often take a long time to shutdown. Tried to make things a little more
  friendly in that situation.

*squid-2.4.2s-r6 (1 Feb 2002)

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
  
  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
