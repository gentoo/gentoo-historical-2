  Upstream upgrade.  Added a patch to make cocoon compile with JDK1.4 (WRT
  JDBC3).  The ebuild has temporary hacks to install PHP and JFOR support;
  this will be replaced when PHP and JFOR Portage packages are available.
  Also, JNDI support is enabled if JNDI is available.  This ebuild works with
  both JDK1.4 and 1.3.  Tom von Schwerdtner contributed to this ebuild.
