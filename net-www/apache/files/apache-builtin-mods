# This is a config file for choosing which Apache built-in modules you
# want and how they should be compiled.  You have the option of either
# compiling them statically into the apache binary, or building them
# as DSO's (Dynamic Shared Object).  Please consult some documentation
# for reasons why you'd want one versus the other.  This file simply
# helps to make your life easier when customizing and upgrading your
# Apache server.  The defaults are _fine_ for most users, and it is
# assumed you _know_ what you're doing if you change things in here.
#
# This file will be installed into /etc/apache when you first emerge
# Apache.  If/when you upgrade by installing a newer version, it will
# be consulted for your options.  In this way, your previous
# configuration is preserved without the need to edit the actual
# ebuild.  The default configuration in the Apache ebuild's files/
# directory is used as a fallback if the one in /etc/apache is not
# available.
#
# To compile a module statically into the apache binary, simply put
# static beside it.  To compile a module as a DSO, put shared beside
# it.  To disable a module, simply put a - as the first character on
# the line.
#
# Examples:
# mod_access shared    ( this would build a DSO )
# mod_actions static   ( this would get compiled statically )
# - mod_alias shared   ( this module would not be built at all )
#
# Please be aware that if you _do_ customize these then you'll need
# to manually adjust your apache.conf file, tweaking the LoadModule
# and AddModule lines accordingly or else your server will fail to
# start!  You've been warned ;)
