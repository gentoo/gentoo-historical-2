################# vhosts.conf
#This is where we store the VirtualHosts configuration.
#
#Since Apache 1.3.19, we modified the setup to include some nice tricks:
#
#- We added the User and Group directives so VirtualHosts now work with
#  suexec directive. If set, Apache will run all cgi scripts under that
#  user and group (provided the uid and gid are > 1000 for security). The
#  directories and cgi files *must* belong to that user/group for the
#  feature to work
#- We added the Setenv VLOG directive. This works in conjunction with
#  the CustomLog in commonapache2.conf. When Setenv VLOG is set, apache will
#  create a /var/log/apache2/VLOG-YYYY-MM-<ServerName>.log instead of logging
#  to access_log. Use this instead of defining a special logfile for
#  each vhost, otherwise you eat up file descriptors.
#- You can also specify a path for the VLOG for each Vhost, for example,
#  to place the logs in each user's directory. However, if you want to
#  use the file for accounting, place it in a directory owned by root,
#  otherwise the user will be able to erase it.
#- I suggest only including the ErrorLog *only* if the vhost will use
#  cgi scripts. Again, it saves file descriptors!
