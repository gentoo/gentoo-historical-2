# Config file for /etc/init.d/apache

# Here's an example from /etc/apache/conf/apache.conf using mod_ssl:
#
# <IfDefine SSL>
# LoadModule ssl_module    extramodules/libssl.so
# </IfDefine>
#
# This means that libssl.so is only loaded into the server when you
# pass "-D SSL" to it at startup.
#
# Anything else in apache.conf which is guarded similarly, like:
#
# <IfDefine FOO> ... </IfDefine>
#
# can be easily turned on/off by editing APACHE_OPTS below to
# include or to not include "-D FOO".
#
# If you installed mod_throttle, you can add "-D THROTTLE"; if you
# installed mod_dav, then add "-D DAV".  For mod_gzip use "-D GZIP".
# The mod_contribs package has several options you can use.  See
# your apache.conf file for more details.


#APACHE_OPTS="-D SSL -D PHP4"
