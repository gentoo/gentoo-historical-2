*apache-1.3.24-r1 (9 Apr 2002)

  9 Apr 2002; Donny Davies <woodchip@gentoo.org> apache-1.3.24-r1.ebuild :

  Massive port rewrite! Borrowed many ideas/pieces from abroad, but mostly Mandrake :)

  o data is now in /home/httpd/{htdocs,icons,cgi-bin} (new standard location for Gentoo)
  o server runs as user/group apache
  o mod_ssl is split into a several package (plus i've added several more mods)
  o now using the mm library to provide modules with shared memory pools
  o now links with the expat library
  o all modules are now dynamically linked using SHARED_CHAIN (smaller mod sizes)
  o several patches from debian/mandrake are included, fixing several issues. the
    most interesting patch is the mandrake serverroot patch, which makes configuring
    apache much easier, and also provides some really great organization.
  o the EAPI patch is now turned on unconditionally.  (previously you only got it
    if you had ssl in your USE variable)
  o provide an easy way for people to tune up the HARD_SERVER_LIMIT
  o created a configuration file for the modules distributed with apache. this
    allows you to finely customize your modules, and even preserve this configuration
    across upgrades.  A Gentoo-only feature ;)
  o suexec is fixed now.  it is restricted to user/group apache as well.
  o added several support scripts (from mandrake) which allow easy addition and
    removal of third-party modules into the apache.conf setup.  this makes writing
    ebuilds for third-party modules much easier.  see net-www/mod_* for examples.
  o the config files are now in /etc/apache/conf, conveniently organized into
    separate directories for addon-modules and vhosts.  this greatly simplifies
    things especially for people with complicated/large sites.
