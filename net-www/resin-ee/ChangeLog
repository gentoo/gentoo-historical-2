*resin-ee-2.1.9 (30 Apr 2003)

  30 Apr 2003; Dylan Carlson <absinthe@gentoo.org> resin-ee-2.1.9.ebuild,
  files/2.1.9/21resin, files/2.1.9/resin-ee.diff, files/2.1.9/resin.conf,
  files/2.1.9/resin.init:
  Initial import.
  
  With the addition of EE, I am setting both net-www/resin and net-www/resin-ee
  to block each other. The only real difference from an installation perspective
  is that resin-ee classes install to /usr/share/resin-ee/lib/. While it is
  possible to configure both ebuilds to install to different locations, I doubt
  this will be of any practical value to anyone (since logically you would never
  run both on the same system).
  
  If anyone feels strongly against this, file a bug and it will be re-evaluated.
