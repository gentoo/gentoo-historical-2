	This is the package of the revived GPLFLash, and is based on Olivier
	Debons original work, which hasen't had a release since June 2000.
	This project hope to bring GPLFlash back as a free, portable and
	useable alternative to the flash-decoder released by Macromedia.
	The project contains a decoding library, a player and (perhaps most
	importantly) a mozilla/netscape plugin.
