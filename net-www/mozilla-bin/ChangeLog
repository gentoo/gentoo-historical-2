*mozilla-bin-1.7.2 (04 Aug 2004)

  04 Aug 2004; Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org> +metadata.xml,
  +files/mozilla-bin-icon.png, +files/mozilla-bin.desktop,
  +mozilla-bin-1.7.2.ebuild:
  Bring back mozilla-bin. It's been gone for two years. Having these
  mozilla.org-built versions in portage makes it easier to test differences
  between our builds and theirs. And nowadays they can both be installed
  simultaneously.
