Vacation is a Horde module for managing user e-mail "vacation notices" 
or "auto-responders." It works via a local vacation program which must 
be installed and functioning on the server. It supports vacation 
programs using the .forward-style forwarding mechanism supported by 
several popular mailers, as well as qmail and sql based implementations. 
While it has been released and is in production use at many sites, it is 
also under heavy development in an effort to expand and improve the 
module.

Right now, Vacation provides fairly complete support for managing 
.forward-style vacation notices on sendmail or courier mail based 
systems via an FTP transport. It also has some support for qmail and 
exim sql based servers.
