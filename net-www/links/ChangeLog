*links-2.1_pre2 (11 Sep 2002)

  11 Sep 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> links-2.1_pre2-r2.ebuild
  files/digest-links-2.1_pre2-r2 :

  From: kevin@aptbasilicata.it (Maurizio Disimino) in bug # 7809

  at the moment, links will be compiled with --enable-graphics only if
  USE="png". If --enable-graphics is not supplied, fb WILL NOT WORK.
  Moreover, --enable-graphis should be enabled for 'X' or 'fbcon'.

  Note: if X or fbcon usegflag are enabled, links will be built in 
  graphic mode. libpng is required to compile links in graphic mode 
  not required in textmode),so let's add libpng for X? and fbcon?

     X? ( virtual/x11 >=media-libs/libpng-1.2.1 )
	    fbcon? ( >=media-libs/libpng-1.2.1 )"

		- Fixed DEPEND and src_compile().
		- Some cosmetic changes.

  Added a patch to fix links 0.96 compiling against gpm, since the previous

  the excellent patch and ebuild. This fix's bug 5351.
