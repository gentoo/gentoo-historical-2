<longdescription>
Eterm is a color vt102 terminal emulator intended as a replacement for 
xterm. It is designed with a Freedom of Choice philosophy, leaving as 
much power, flexibility, and freedom as possible in the hands of the 
user. It is designed to look good and work well, but takes a 
feature-rich approach rather than one of minimalism while still 
maintaining speed and efficiency.
