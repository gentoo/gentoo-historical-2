*rsstool-1.0.0_rc3 (03 Sep 2007)

  03 Sep 2007; Jason Smathers (jsin) <jsin@gentoo.org>
  +rsstool-1.0.0_rc3.ebuild:
  Bumped to rc3, patches no longer required as they were incorperated upstream.

*rsstool-1.0.0_rc2-r1 (25 Aug 2007)

  25 Aug 2007; Jason Smathers (jsin) <jsin@gentoo.org>
  +files/rsstool-1.0.0_rc2-Makefile.patch,
  +files/rsstool-1.0.0_rc2-config.mak.patch, +metadata.xml,
  +rsstool-1.0.0_rc2-r1.ebuild:
  New ebuild for bug #186778, I had this in Sunrise which I will now remove.
  This revision removes the presets patch as it is broken upstream and will be
  removed upstream soon.  Furthermore, the Makefile is patched to respect user
  CFLAGS and LDFLAGS and to stop the forced stripping of binaries.
