  openldap-2.1.10.ebuild, files/digest-openldap-2.0.27-r1,
  files/digest-openldap-2.1.10, files/slapd-2.1.rc6,

  18 Dec 2002; Nick Hadaway <raker@gentoo.org> openldap-2.1.9.ebuild,
  files/digest-openldap-2.1.9 :

  03 Dec 2002; Will Woods <wwoods@gentoo.org> openldap-1.2.13-r6.ebuild:

*openldap-2.0.27 (25 Nov 2002)

  21 Dec 2002; Nick Hadaway <raker@gentoo.org> openldap-2.0.27.ebuild :
  db4 is not required for this version.  Also fixed readline
  dependancy as to not squash the 1.0 profile.

  27 Nov 2002; Nick Hadaway <raker@gentoo.org> openldap-2.0.27.ebuild,
  files/digest-openldap-2.0.27 :
  Updated stable series of openldap.

*openldap-2.1.8 (25 Nov 2002)

  25 Nov 2002; Nick Hadaway <raker@gentoo.org> openldap-2.1.8.ebuilod,
  files/digest-openldap-2.1.8 :
  New ebuild of openldap.  Lots of configure updates.  Needs lots of
  testing.  The ebuild depends on db4 so all arches are marked - until
  db4 is marked unstable for testing.

*openldap-2.0.25-r3 (21 Sept 2002)

  11 Oct 2002; Nick Hadaway <raker@gentoo.org> openldap-2.0.25-r3.ebuild :
  Removed sasl support as saslv2 support is not complete in this and
  causes a circular dependancy with cyrus-sasl.  cyrus-sasl still has
  ldap support built in.
 
  21 Sept 2002; Grant Goodyear <g2boojum@gentoo.org> openldap-2.0.25-r3.ebuild	
  Replaced entire make install section w/ "make DESTDIR=${D} install".
  The previous version was putting ${D} in the /etc/openldap files, and
  the simple fix seems to have solved the problem.   I also checked, and
  sysconfdir seems to be working correctly, so I don't think I've broken
  Seemant's fix.

*openldap-2.0.25-r2 (15 Aug 2002)
 
  16 Sep 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> openldap-2.0.25-r2.ebuild	
  Fixed sysconfdir to /etc so that config files go into the /etc/openldap
  directory instead of /etc/openldap/openldap.  Thanks to:
  gdjohn@egregious.org.uk (Gareth John) in bug #7986
 
  07 Sep 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org>
  openldap-2.0.25-r2.ebuild :
  Fixed the use flags so that they are not prefixed with "ldap-"  as
  discovered by jap1@ionet.net (Jacob Perkins) and kevin@aptbasilicata.it
  (j2ee) in bug #7597

  15 Aug 2002; Nick Hadaway <raker@gentoo.org>

*openldap-2.0.25-r1 (29 Jul 2002)

  12 Aug 2002; Mark Guertin <gerk@gentoo.org> :                                 
  Added ppc to keywords                                                         

  29 Jul 2002; Nick Hadaway <raker@gentoo.org>
  openldap-2.0.25-r1, files/slapd.rc6, files/digest-openldap-2.0.25-r1 :
  Updated ebuild for proper USE flag to configure option generation.  Fixed
  a typo in slapd.rc6.  Bumping to -r1 due to the many changes in the ebuild
  since the first 2.0.25 release.

*openldap-2.0.25 (17 Jul 2002)

  26 Jul 2002; Nick Hadaway <raker@gentoo.org> files/slapd.rc6 :

  error messages when shutting doesn slapd.

  26 Jul 2002; Nick Hadaway <raker@gentoo.org>
  re-modified ebuild so localstatedir=/var/state/openldap to match with the
  default slapd config file.  /var/state/openldap/openldap-ldbm and
  /var/state/openldap/openldap-slurp are also created correctly.
  Bug #5557 re-visited.

  26 Jul 2002; Nick Hadaway <raker@gentoo.org>
  modified ebuild to create a /var/state/openldap to conicide with default
  configuration of where databases are stored.  Closes bug #5557.
