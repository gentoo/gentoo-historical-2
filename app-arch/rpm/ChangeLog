\* Autoupdate keywords (12-6-02)
  06 Dec 2002; Rodney Rees <manson@gentoo.org> changed sparc ~sparc keywords
 
*rpm-4.0.4-r4 (12 Oct 2002)

  12 Oct 2002; Bruce A. Locke <blocke@shivan.org> rpm-4.0.4-r4.ebuild:
  Remove dead symlink (bug #8578) and ebuild no longer blindly creates
  a database if one already exists.

*rpm-4.0.4-r3 (23 Jul 2002)

  14 Sep 2002; Maarten Thibaut <murphy@gentoo.org> ChangeLog rpm-4.0.4-r3.ebuild: 
  This package can not compile on sparc64 without a --host option to configure,
  so I added that flag. Revamped ChangeLog layout according to new guidelines.
  
  07 Sep 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> rpm-4.0.4-r3.ebuild: 
  This package can not compile with autoconf-2.53a, so autoconf-2.1 is forced. 
  Thanks to:  garion@garion.mnbsyr.com (John Sutherland) in bug #7595

  23 Jul 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> rpm-4.0.4-r3.ebuild: In keeping
  with RH tradition, this package requires bloat.  As such, gettext is not optional,
  it is _required_.  Go figure.  Takes care of part of bug #5425, as reported by:
  Balaji Rangaswamy <krab@rediffmail.com>

*rpm-4.0.4-r2 (29 Jun 2002)

  15 Jul 2002; Owen Stampflee <owen@gentoo.org> rpm-4.0.4-r2.ebuild: Added PPC to
  KEYWORDS.

  29 May 2002; Jon Nelson <jnelson@gentoo.org> rpm-4.0.4-r2.ebuild: Fix bug #4070 -
  db dependency too strict

*rpm-4.0.4-r1 (13 May 2002)

  13 May 2002; Dan Armak <danarmak@gentoo.org> ChangeLog: Fix bug #1893 - make rpm
  use the system libpopt (dev-libs/popt) instead of installing its own.

*rpm-4.0.4 (23 April 2002)

  23 April 2002; Bart Verwilst <verwilst@gentoo.org> ChangeLog: New up-to-date
  version, keeping the previous one for now..

*rpm-3.0.6-r1 (1 Feb 2002)

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog: Added initial ChangeLog
  which should be updated whenever the package is updated in any way. This
  changelog is targetted to users. This means that the comments should well
  explained and written in clean English. The details about writing correct
  changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you can find in
  the root directory of the portage repository.
