*rpm-4.0.4-r3 (23 Jul 2002)

  07 Sep 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> rpm-4.0.4-r3.ebuild :

  This package can not compile with autoconf-2.53a, so autoconf-2.1 is
  forced.  Thanks to: garion@garion.mnbsyr.com (John Sutherland) in bug
  #7595

  23 Jul 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> rpm-4.0.4-r3.ebuild :

  In keeping with RH tradition, this package requires bloat.  As such,
  gettext is not optional, it is _required_.  Go figure.  Takes care of part
  of bug #5425, as reported by: Balaji Rangaswamy <krab@rediffmail.com>

*rpm-4.0.4-r2 (29 Jun 2002)

  15 Jul 2002; Owen Stampflee <owen@gentoo.org> :

  Added PPC to KEYWORDS.

  29 May 2002; Jon Nelson <jnelson@gentoo.org> rpm-4.0.4-r2.ebuild:

  Fix bug #4070 - db dependency too strict

*rpm-4.0.4-r1 (13 May 2002)

  13 May 2002; Dan Armak <danarmak@gentoo.org> changelog:
  
  Fix bug #1893 - make rpm use the system libpopt (dev-libs/popt) instead of
  installing its own.

*rpm-4.0.4 (23 April 2002)

  23 April 2002; Bart Verwilst <verwilst@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :

  New up-to-date version, keeping the previous one for now..

*rpm-3.0.6-r1 (1 Feb 2002)

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
  
  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
