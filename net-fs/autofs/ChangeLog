  07 Jan 2003; Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org> autofs-3.1.7-r6.ebuild:
  Add alpha to KEYWORDS

*autofs-3.1.7-r5 (17 Nov 2002)
  
  17 Nov 2002; Brad Cowan <bcowan@gebtoo.org> autofs-3.1.7-r5.ebuild,
  files/digest-autofs-3.1.7-r5, files/ldap_config.patch, files/autofs.rc8 :

  More ldap fixes, init script still needs some tweaking.

*autofs-3.1.7-r4 (27 Oct 2002)
  
  20 Sep 2002; Brad Cowan <bradlyatc@cowancomputers.com> autofs-3.1.7-r4.ebuild :
  files/digest-autofs-3.1.7-r4, files/nisyp.patch, files/autofs1.confd, 
  files/autofs.rc7, files/automount.diff.
  
  Added net-nds/portmap and net-nds/ypbind as RDEPEND, updated init scripts 
  remove old files, and Updated ChangeLog. Init script now has a working
  stats option to display current autofs state (as status seems to be a 
  predefined function that only displays the whether the daemon is running or 
  stopped). Added einfo to ebuild noting to start portmap for NFS support without 
  NFS started on current setup. Hopefully fixed some library compile problems.
  
*autofs-3.1.7-r3 (16 Apr 2002)

  made the initscript depend on ypbind

  files/digest-autofs-3.1.7-r3 :
