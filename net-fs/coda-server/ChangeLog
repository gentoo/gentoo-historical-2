  coda-server-5.3.19.ebuild ChangeLog files/coda-server-5.3.19-gentoo.patch
  files/digest-coda-server-5.3.19 :

  New package.  This is the coda-client ebuild with a two line change: the
  coda client's initscript patch is not applied, and the einstall installs
  coda-server instead of coda-client.  This ebuild was requested by: Joe
  <ptlame@core.com> in bug #13696, but I don't want to support it, so it's
  looking for a maintainer.
