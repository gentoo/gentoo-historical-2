*samba-2.2.3a-r1 (5 March 2002)

  5 March 2002; M.Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> samba-2.2.3a-r1.ebuild,
                                                samba-2.2.3a-loadparm.c.patch,
						samba-2.2.3a-proto.c.patch,
						samba-2.2.3a-reply.h.patch

  Move the patches to ${FILESDIR}, as they have the same names as those for
  2.2.2, but is not the same, thus ibiblio do not cache the new ones, and
  we get digest errors.

*samba-2.2.3a (4 March 2002)

  4 March 2002; Donny Davies <woodchip@gentoo.org> samba-2.2.3a.ebuild, 
  files/samba-2.2.3a-cli_spoolss_notify.diff, files/samba-2.2.3a-pam_smbpass.diff,
  files/samba-2.2.2-XFS-quota.diff :

  Added acl USE flag support, patch to fix pam_smbpass compilation, patch for Win2k
  printing and removed XFS quota patch -- its merged upstream.  Updated to latest
  network recycle bin patches.  If you get md5 checksum errors with the recycle bin
  patches then:  delete the 3 patches from your local distfiles, and comment out
  your GENTOO_MIRRORS from make.conf/make.globals.  This will ensure that the
  proper patches are fetched from the author's site.
