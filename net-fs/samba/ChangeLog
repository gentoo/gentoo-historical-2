  directory.  These files are now in /var/lib/samba/codepages.  /var/run/smb
  has moved to /var/run/samba.  Simply move your /var/run/smb/* to
  /var/run/samba.  If you have the string "/etc/smb" in your smb.conf file,
  then please change all occurances of that to "/etc/samba".  Added a
  sample smbusers file.  Added an xinetd snippet for the swat service.

  samba-2.2.3a-loadparm.c.patch, samba-2.2.3a-proto.c.patch,
  samba-2.2.3a-reply.h.patch :

  Move the patches to ${FILESDIR}, as they have the same names as those for

  we get digest errors.

  network recycle bin patches.  If you get md5 checksum errors with the recycle bin

  your GENTOO_MIRRORS from make.conf/make.globals.  This will ensure that the
  proper patches are fetched from the author's site.
