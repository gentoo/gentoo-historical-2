  03 Mar 2003; Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org> nfs-utils-1.0.1-r1.ebuild,
  files/nfs-1:
  Fix bug 16075 by installing server binaries into /usr/sbin (thanks Tero
  Pelander for the clue and the updated ebuild). Fix bug 13838 by using
  rpc.rquotad from the quota package instead of the nfs-utils version (thanks
  Andrea Barisani for the heads-up). Finally, mark stable on x86 and alpha
  where I can test as part of the package upgrade phase.
