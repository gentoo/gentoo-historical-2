*openafs-legacy-0.1 (27 Jul 2005)

  27 Jul 2005; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> +metadata.xml,
  +openafs-legacy-0.1.ebuild:
  New package, created by: Stefaan De Roeck <stefaan.deroeck@gmail.com>
  As a guide for these links, acinclude.m4 from the openafs package was
  used.  A README file exists as well, but at the time of writing, the
  afsbosserver-variable was inaccurately described.  The idea here is that the
  new openafs ebuilds install into FHS correct locations, despite the
  protestations of one   Martin Mokrejs <mmokrejs@ribosome.natur.cuni.cz>.
  Please do not use this, as it is only useful with openafs-1.2.13 and openafs-1.3.85 and up.
