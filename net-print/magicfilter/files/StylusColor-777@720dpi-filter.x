# All documents sent to the printer should be prefixed by the magic
# command and the reset code.  The 'magic command' takes the printer
# out of the Epson packet mode communication protocol (whatever that
# is) and enables normal data transfer.  The 'reset code' discards any
# output, ejects the existing page, and returns all settings to their
# default.

# Native printer control codes start with <ESC>, but if this wasn't
# recognized by the magic above, then the reset code should be
# prefixed.  Then we pass the document to the printer, cross our
# fingers and hope for the best.
#
# Note that we add a ff/reset on the end just for good measure...
