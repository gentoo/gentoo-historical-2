# Note: this also d/ls the hp-ppa-howto and installs it under /usr/share/doc/${P}

# pnm2ppa is a print filter for HP's line of Winprinters which use a proprietary
# protocol called ppa (Print Performance Architecture). Like Winmodems, Winprinters
# don't have a microprocessor; your main CPU does all the hard work.
# Winprinters: Hp Deskjet 710, 712, 720, 722, 820, 1000 series.
# pnm2ppa can work on its own or via lpr or pdq.

# The ebuild in general seems a bit flaky, anyone who has a ppa printer
# please check it out and tell me if it worked.

# Description of accompanying patch: install into /usr instead of /usr/local
# and use env. var. CFLAGS. Took a lot of changes though.

DESCRIPTION="Print driver for Hp Deskjet 710, 712, 720, 722, 820, 1000 series"

# note: this doesn't depend on virtual/lpr, because it can work on its own,
# just without queueing etc. since it's not just a driver but a standalone
# executable.
