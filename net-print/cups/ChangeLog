*cups-1.1.13 (1 Feb 2002)

  1 Feb 2002; Donny Davies <woodchip@gentoo.org> /etc/cupsd.conf:

  Updated to the latest release, cups-1.1.13.  Now installing the html docs
  into /usr/share/cups/docs, which will let people upgrade cups in the
  future without having to change /etc/cupsd.conf to point to a new
  directory.  Makes things a little more user friendly.

*cups-1.1.12 (1 Feb 2002)

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
  
  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
