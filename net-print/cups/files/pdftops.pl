# pdftops.pl - wrapper script for xpdf's pdftops utility to act as a CUPS filter

#
# Description:
# ------------
#	This program wraps the pdftops utility from the xpdf 3.00 (and higher) suite
#	to behave as a CUPS filter as a replacement for the original pdftops filter.
#
#	The main purpose of this approach is to keep the properties of a PDF to be
#	printed as undesturbed as possible, especially with respect to page size,
#	scaling, and positioning.
#
#	The pdftops utility reads a configuration file 'pdftops.conf' in the 
#	CUPS_SERVERROOT directory, which must exist but may be empty. The sample
#	configuration file accompanying this program sets the defaults which
#	seem plausible to me with respect to high end production printers.
#
#	To give the user highest possible flexibility, this program accepts and
#	evaluates a set of job attributes special to this filter, which are 
#	described below:
#	
#		pdf-pages=<f>,<l>
#				expands to the -f and -l options of pdftops
#				to select a page range to process. This is independent
#				of the page-ranges attribute and may significantly
#				increase throughput when printing page ranges.
#				Either of these numbers may be omitted.
#
#		pdf-paper=<name>
#		pdf-paper=<width>x<height>
#				<name> may be one of letter, legal , A4, A3, or match;
#				<width> and <height> are the paper width and height
#				in printers points (1/72 inch). This expands to
#				either the -paper or the -paperh and -paperw options
#				of pdftops
#
#		pdf-opw=<password>
#		pdf-upw=<password>
#				expand to the -opw and -upw options of pdftops,
#				respectively and permit printing of password
#				protected PDFs.
#
#		pdf-<option>	where <option> is one of
#				level1, level1sep, level2, level2sep, level3, level3sep,
#				opi, nocrop, expand, noshrink, nocenter.
#				See the pdftops manpage for a detailed description of
#				the respective options.
#
#	All other pdftops commandline options are refused.
#
#	When printing from STDIN, the program copies the input to a temporary file
#	in TMPDIR, which is deleted on exit.
#
#	The return code of the pdftops utility, if nonzero, is used as the exit code
#	of this program; error messages of the pdftops utility are only visible
#	if 'debug' is specified as LogLevel in cupsd.conf.
