  14 Sep 2005; Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org> tlf-0.9.23.ebuild:
  Mark 0.9.23 stable on alpha

*tlf-0.9.23 (30 Mar 2005)

  30 Mar 2005; Robb Romans <killsoft@gentoo.org> +tlf-0.9.23.ebuild:
  New version 0.9.23
  * New function: start cw before call is complete. In contest mode, you can
    start sending the call from the call window with 'space' or with
    'down-arrow'.
  * New command: :CHAR asks for number of characters the call must have before
    sending starts. Default: 0 = OFF. If CHARS is 3, tlf starts sending as soon
    as you have input the first 3 letters of the call. If you are on slow speed
    you then have time to complete the call (including backspacing) before
    sending the first 3 letters is finished. This is of limited use when running
    above 40 wpm :)
  * incorporated patch from W9WI fixing a bug in the voice keyer.
  * changed cw speed control: now default active in call and exchange fields,
    even if field is not empty
  * changed qso save logic: RETURN now always logs the qso in SSB and in general
    qso mode.
  * New parameter: CHANGE_RST. If set in logcfg.dat, Pg-up and Pg-down will
    change RST instead of CW speed if field is not empty. Default: off.
  * fixed nasty bug which caused CQDELAY to start at 0 instead of the default in
    logcfg.dat
  * manpage updated for version 0.9.23

*tlf-0.9.22 (30 Mar 2005)

  30 Mar 2005; Robb Romans <killsoft@gentoo.org> tlf-0.9.22.ebuild:
  Mark stable on x86

  15 Feb 2005; Robb Romans <killsoft@gentoo.org> :
  * New upstream version 0.9.22
  
  * This release fixes a bug to make it compatible with
    gcc-4.0 / AMD64
  
  * The (local swedish) ssa_mt contest has changed its
    exchange format into serial number + 4-character grid
    field. This made it necessary to make a new parameter
    called SERIAL+GRID4. Tlf extracts the first 4 characters
    for the multiplier.
    
  * Input format:
    e.g. 01 JO21QI, the mult will be JO21.
  
  * The rules file has also been updated.
  
  * Man page updated for version 0.9.22.

  08 Dec 2004; Robb Romans <killsoft@gentoo.org> :
  Changes:
  (0.9.21)
  * The cw sidetone setting (TONE) in logcfg.dat has become CWTONE=
  * A new parameter LOWBANDS_DOUBLE has been introduced
  * A new parameter CLUSTER_LOG has been intgroduced. When set
    the cluster messages are written to a 'clusterlog' file... this can be tailed
    to a terminal window (tail -f clusterlog) for people who are on a dead band,
    so they can watch the game.
  * The initial exchange function now also recognises embedded
    calls (CT3/PA0R/QRP)
  * The logcfg.dat template has been updated to version 0.9.21.
  * The manpage has been updated to version 0.9.21.
