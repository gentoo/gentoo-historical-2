  08 Dec 2004; Robb Romans <killsoft@gentoo.org> :
  Changes for xlog version 0.9.12
  * Opening/closing the worked before dialog now correctly sets the
    corresponding optionmenu.
  * When a new log is created the corresponding filename is now created
    correctly.
  * The README has been left out of the help menu and is migrated with the
    MANUAL. It is now included with the source code only.
  * Some effort has been done to compile cleanly with mingw. Untested.
  * Polish translations by Boguslaw Ciastek, SQ5TB. Thanks!

*xlog-0.9.7 (01 Oct 2004)

  01 Oct 2004; Robb Romans <killsoft@gentoo.org> +xlog-0.9.7.ebuild:

  Changes for xlog version 0.9.7
    * A fix by Nigel Horne, G0LOV for a NULL pointer deref in dxcc.c, which would
      cause crashes on some architectures. Thanks!
    * xlog will now also build with older libgnomeprint versions.
    * The ChangeLog is now included in the help menu and the xlog data directory.
    * When importing from trlog, the date is converted to your current locale.
    * If there is a comment in a trlog file (lines starting with ';'), it will
      be imported and added to the remarks field.
    * Another printing fix. People on redhat have been reporting overlapping
      columns, a new way of column width calculation fixes this. Thanks to Tomi,
      OH2BNS and Alex, OZ9AEC for testing.
