*xlog-1.1 (16 Feb 2005)

  16 Feb 2005; Robb Romans <killsoft@gentoo.org> +xlog-1.1.ebuild:
  - Changes for xlog version 1.1
  * Several cleanups in the function which creates the main window, the toolbar
    now uses the GtkAction API, toolbar items are now also accessable through
    the edit menu and the vertical handlebar can move freely to the left.
  * "Tab" in the menu has been renamed to "Page".
  * You can hide the number column by using the log-editor and entering a zero
    column width for this column.
  * The BUGS file has been added to the help menu, with a description on how to
    report bugs.
  * The logeditor has been redesigned so it fits on a 800x600 display.
  * Most of the dialogs have been cleaned up and partly rewritten, so they
    will load faster.
  * Xlog now correctly recognizes the 60 meters band. Thanks to Harv Nelson,
    AI9NL for notifying. 
  * At ADIF import, frequencies with a comma are converted to a dot.
  * A gtk+ version check has been added, which will display an error at
    startup if the version is below 2.4.
  * An error will be displayed when trying to load a non-xlog file.
  * The labels export format has been renamed TSV (Tab Separated Value).
  * You can decide which fields to export in the TSV format (used by glabels),
    by going to Settings->Dialogs and checking wanted the fields in the
    "Save As" page.
  * When hamlib is enabled, rounding of the digits is now also possible when
    the s-meter is not visible.
  * When entering a logname in the new log dialog, dash (-) and underscore (_)
    are now also allowed.
  * Polish MANUAL and FAQ added by Boguslaw Ciastek, SQ5TB.
  * The position of the paned window is now remembered at program exit.

  08 Dec 2004; Robb Romans <killsoft@gentoo.org> :
  Changes for xlog version 0.9.12
  * Opening/closing the worked before dialog now correctly sets the
    corresponding optionmenu.
  * When a new log is created the corresponding filename is now created
    correctly.
  * The README has been left out of the help menu and is migrated with the
    MANUAL. It is now included with the source code only.
  * Some effort has been done to compile cleanly with mingw. Untested.
  * Polish translations by Boguslaw Ciastek, SQ5TB. Thanks!

*xlog-0.9.7 (01 Oct 2004)

  01 Oct 2004; Robb Romans <killsoft@gentoo.org> +xlog-0.9.7.ebuild:
  New version, thanks to Douglas Gallup for the contribution.
  Closes bug 64351
  
  Changes for xlog version 0.9.7
    * A fix by Nigel Horne, G0LOV for a NULL pointer deref in dxcc.c, which would
      cause crashes on some architectures. Thanks!
    * xlog will now also build with older libgnomeprint versions.
    * The ChangeLog is now included in the help menu and the xlog data directory.
    * When importing from trlog, the date is converted to your current locale.
    * If there is a comment in a trlog file (lines starting with ';'), it will
      be imported and added to the remarks field.
    * Another printing fix. People on redhat have been reporting overlapping
      columns, a new way of column width calculation fixes this. Thanks to Tomi,
      OH2BNS and Alex, OZ9AEC for testing.
