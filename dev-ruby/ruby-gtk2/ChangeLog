*ruby-gtk2-0.5.0-r1 (06 Aug 2003)

  06 Aug 2003; Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org> ruby-gtk2-0.5.0-r1.ebuild:
  Update this ebuild to use the new ruby-gnome2.eclass.  The effects of this
  change are:

    1. All the ruby-gnome2 ebuilds use the same source tarball, so there's
       less overall to download.

    2. This ebuild doesn't supply pango, glib2 or gdk_pixbuf2. Instead it
       RDEPENDS on the appropriate ruby-* ebuilds. I did a careful comparison
       to make sure that the file listing of the combined packages is
       equivalent to the previous file listing of this single package. 

    3. The ebuild is a lot smaller and easier to maintain.

	4. I removed the KEYWORDS I'm fairly certain were not added by the
	   appropriate arch teams.  Considering how many bugs crop up when
	   bindings like this are built on another architecture, I think it's best
	   to follow policy on this.
