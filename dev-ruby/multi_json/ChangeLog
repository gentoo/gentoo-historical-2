  19 Jun 2010; Diego E. Petten√≤ <flameeyes@gentoo.org>
  +multi_json-0.0.3.ebuild, +files/multi_json-0.0.3-gentoo.patch,
  +metadata.xml:
  Initial import of multi_json needed for the new version of oauth2. The
  tests are particularly patched (and not all of it is upstreamed yet) so
  that they pass on Ruby 1.9 and JRuby properly.
