Subject: [PATCH] spec: do not force simplecov presence.
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

For Gentoo packaging for instance we don't want to know how much of
the code is covered by the tests, we just want to make sure that the
tests pass properly.
