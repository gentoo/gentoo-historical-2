*ruby-1.6.7 (4 Mar 2002)

  4 Mar 2002; Karl Trygve Kalleberg <karltk@gentoo.org> all:

  Ruby is the interpreted scripting language for quick and easy 
  object-oriented programming. It has many features to process text files 
  and to do system management tasks (as in Perl). It is simple, 
  straight-forward, extensible, and portable.

  Moved from dev-lang/ruby to dev-ruby/ruby.

  Ebuild submitted by Tuurlijk <gentoo@tuurlijk.eu.org>
