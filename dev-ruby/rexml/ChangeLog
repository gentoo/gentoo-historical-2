*rexml-1.2.4 (13 Apr 2002)

  13 Apr 2002; Karl Trygve Kalleberg <karltk@gentoo.org> rexml-1.2.4 files/digest-rexml-1.2.4 :
  
  REXML is an XML processor for the language Ruby. REXML is conformant (passes
  100% of the Oasis non-validating tests), and includes full XPath support. It
  is reasonably fast, and is implemented in pure Ruby. Best of all, it has a 
  clean, intuitive API.
