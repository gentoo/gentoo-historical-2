*ruby-gtk

	21 Apr 2002; Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org> ruby-gtk-0.27.ebuild:

	Modified to use unified ruby-gnome-all tarball; this allows related
	ebuilds to use the same tarball and only download once.

*ruby-gtk-0.27 (13 Apr 2002)

	13 Apr 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> ruby-gtk-0.27.ebuild :

	thomharp@charter.net submitted this updated ebuild in bug #1647.  I have
	cleaned it up slightly to allow future updates to be more flexible.
	However, why did the ruby-gtk (ruby-gnome) people have to change the
	naming convention?

*ruby-gtk-0.26 (1 Feb 2002)

	1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :

	Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
	updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that
	the comments should well explained and written in clean English. The
	details about writing correct changelogs are explained in the
	skel.ChangeLog file which you can find in the root directory of the
	portage repository.
