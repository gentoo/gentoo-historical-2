I. Introduction

	blah, blah, blah... (I'll fill this in later)

II. The Portage Tree

	The portage tree is a heirarchy, in which the first level is
	the category, and the second is the name of the package.

  A. What (Not) to Put in the Portage Tree

	The portage tree should only include ebuild files, and other
	files in the 'files' directory for each package. No binary
	files should be placed in the portage tree. No files that can
	be downloaded from other sources (such as patches written by
	other people) should be put here. No patches you write
	yourself should be compressed.

  B. Categories

	The categories are defined as follows:

	app-admin - non-critical system administration utilities

	app-arch - non-critical archival/compression utilities

	app-cdr - CD recording utilities

	app-doc - application documentation

	app-editors - non-critical text editors

	app-emulation - packages for emulating other systems/OSes

	app-misc - applications that don't fit anywhere else

	app-office - office-type (word processing, spreadsheet, etc.)
		packages

	app-shells - non-critical shells and command interpreters

	app-text - text processing, spell checkers, and document
		formatting packages

	dev-db - database libraries

	dev-java - java classes/packages/etc.

	dev-lang - compilers and interpreters for different languages

	dev-libs - miscellaneous developer's libraries

	dev-perl - perl modules

	dev-python - python modules

	dev-ruby - ruby modules

	dev-util - various developers utilities

	gnome-apps - applications for gnome

	gnome-base - base gnome packages

	gnome-libs - non-essential gnome libraries

	gnome-office - office packages for gnome

	kde-apps - applications for kde

	kde-base - base kde packages

	kde-i18n - kde internationalization packages

	media-gfx - graphics related programs

	media-libs - libraries for manipulating different media,
		including accessing multimedia peripherals of your
		computer (sound card, video card, etc.)

	media-sound - programs related to sound, including cd-audio
		and sound encoding

	media-video - programs related to video, including video
		codecs and players

	net-analyzer - network usage statistics monitors/analyzers

	net-dialup - network dialup clients and servers such as pppd

	net-fs - network filesystems

	net-ftp - ftp servers and clients

	net-irc - irc servers and clients

	net-libs - networking related libraries

	net-mail - mtas and muas

	net-misc - miscellaneous servers, clients, firewalls, etc.

	net-nds - NIS/NIS+ and other name services

	net-print - print servers and clients

	net-www - http/www servers and clients

	sys-apps - system-critical applications and utilities

	sys-build - stuff thats in the build tarball; you don't
		normally need any of these packages unless you are
		building your entire system from scratch.

	sys-devel - base development packages, such as gcc and make

	sys-kernel - linux kernels

	sys-libs - system-critical libraries such as glibc

	x11-base - xfree86 and xfree86 drivers for various video cards

	x11-libs - widget sets and other x11 specific libraries

	x11-terms - x11 terminal emulators

	x11-wm - x11 window managers

  C. The files Directory

	Under each package subdirectory is a 'files' directory. You
	should place any patches, configuration files, and other
	auxillary files your package might require in this
	directory. Patches you create yourself just to get your
	package to build should be called '${PF}-gentoo.diff'. You
	should not compress these diffs, since 1) they should not be big
	enough to require compressing, and 2) cvs does not play well
	with binary files.
